<h2>TRANSLATOR'S ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>D'Aubigné's History of the Reformation is so well known
and so highly appreciated as to make it not only unnecessary,
but almost presumptuous, for a mere Translator to
say any thing in commendation of it. The public feeling
unquestionably is, that of the works which have recently
appeared, it is one of the most talented, interesting, important,
and seasonable. The mere lapse of time, aided by
the active misrepresentations of the Romish party, had
begun to make an impression in some degree unfavourable
to the principles of the Reformation. This admirable work
has again placed these principles in their true light. By its
vivid display of what Rome was and did, it has impressively
reminded us of what she still is, and is prepared to do. Her
great boast is, that she has never changed. If so, she longs
to return to her former course, and will return to it the first
moment that circumstances enable her to do so. Being
thus warned, our duty is plain. We must prepare for the
combat; and of all preparations, none promises to be more
effectual than that of thoroughly embuing the public mind
with the facts so graphically delineated, and the principles
so luminously and forcibly expounded in this work of
D'Aubigné.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, Has not this purpose been effected
already, or at least may it not be effected without the instrumentality
of a new translation?</p>

<p>To this question the Translator answers, <i>First</i>, The form
of the present translation and the price at which it is published
place the work within the reach of thousands to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
it might otherwise be a sealed book. <i>Second</i>, While this
Translation is the cheapest in existence, it is also the only
one which can, in strict truth, be regarded as genuine.
The edition from which this translation is made was published
in 1842. The date would have been of little
consequence if the work had continued the same; but
the fact is, that the edition of 1842 is not a reprint,
but a complete revision of the one which preceded it.
Numerous passages of considerable length and great importance
have been introduced, while others which had, on
a careful examination, been deemed redundant or inaccurate,
have been expunged. Surely, after all the pains which
the distinguished author has expended on the improvement
of his work, it is scarcely doing justice either to him or to
the English reader to leave his improvements unknown. In
another respect the present Translation exclusively contains
what is conceived to be a very decided improvement.
All the Notes, the meaning of which is not given in the
Text, have been literally translated. It seemed somewhat
absurd while translating French for the benefit of the
English reader, to be at the same time presenting him with
a large number of passages of untranslated Latin.</p>

<p>While the work has been printed in a form to which the
most fastidious cannot object, it has been issued at a price
which makes it accessible to all. The result, it is hoped,
will be, that D'Aubigné's History of the Reformation will
obtain a circulation somewhat adequate to its merits, and
by its introduction into every family become what it well
deserves to be&mdash;a household book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE LAST EDITION.</h2>


<p>My purpose is not to write the history of a party, but that of one
of the greatest revolutions which has taken place among men&mdash;the
history of a mighty impulse which was given to the world three
centuries ago, and the influence of which is still, in our day, every
where perceived. The history of the Reformation is different from
the history of Protestantism. In the former, every thing bears
testimony to a revival of human nature, to a transformation, social
and religious, emanating from God. In the latter are too often
seen a remarkable degeneracy from primitive principles, party intrigue,
a sectarian spirit, and the impress of petty private feelings.
The history of Protestantism might interest none but Protestants;
the history of the Reformation is for all Christians, or rather all
men.</p>

<p>The historian has a choice in the field in which he is to labour.
He may describe the great events which change the face of a
people, or the face of the world; or he may narrate the calm and
progressive course, whether of a nation, the Church, or mankind,
which usually follows great social changes. Both fields of history
are highly important; but the preference, in point of interest, seems
due to those epochs which, under the name of Revolutions, introduce
a nation or society at large to a new era and a new life.</p>

<p>Such a transformation I have attempted to describe with very
humble powers, hoping that the beauty of the subject will compensate
for my want of ability. In styling it a <i>Revolution</i>, I give
it a name which in our day is in discredit with many, who almost
confound it with <i>revolt</i>. This is a mistake. A revolution is a
change which takes place in the world's affairs. It is something
new evolved (<i>revolvo</i>) from the bosom of humanity; and, indeed,
before the end of the last century, the term was oftener used in a
good than a bad sense. They spoke of "a happy," a "marvellous"
revolution. The Reformation being a re-establishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
principles of primitive Christianity, is the opposite of a revolt. For
that which behoved to revive it was a regenerating&mdash;for that which
must always subsist, a conservative movement. Christianity and
the Reformation, while establishing the grand principle that all
souls are equal in the sight of God, and overthrowing the usurpations
of a haughty priesthood, which presumed to place itself between
the Creator and his creature, lay it down as a fundamental
principle of social order, that all power is of God, and cry aloud to
all, "Love your brethren, fear God, honour the king."</p>

<p>The Reformation differs essentially from the revolutions of antiquity,
and from the greater part of those of modern times. In
these, political changes are in question, and the object is to establish
or overthrow the ascendancy of one, or it may be of many.
The love of truth, of holiness, and eternity, was the simple, yet
powerful, spring by which our Reformation was effected. It marks
a step which human nature has taken in advance. In fact, if man,
instead of pursuing only material, temporal, earthly interests, proposes
to himself a higher aim, aspiring to immaterial and immortal
blessings, he advances and makes progress. The Reformation is
one of the brightest days of this glorious advance. It is a pledge
that the new struggle, which is now being decided, will terminate
in favour of truth, with a triumph still more pure, spiritual, and
splendid.</p>

<p>Christianity and the Reformation are the two greatest revolutions
on record. Unlike the different political movements of which
we read, they took place not in one nation merely, but in several
nations, and their effects must be felt to the end of the world.</p>

<p>Christianity and the Reformation are the same revolution,
effected at different times, and under different circumstances.
They vary in secondary features, but are identical in their primary
and principal lineaments. The one is a repetition of the
other. The one ended the old, the other began the new world;
the middle ages lie between. The one gave birth to the other,
and if, in some respects, the daughter bears marks of inferiority,
she on the other hand has her own peculiar properties.</p>

<p>One of these is the rapidity of her action. The great revolutions
which have issued in the fall of a monarchy, and the
change of a whole political system, or which have thrown the human
mind on a new course of development, were slowly and gradually
prepared. The old power had long been undermined,
and its principal buttresses had one after another disappeared.
It was so on the introduction of Christianity. But the Reformation
is seen, at the first glance, to present a different aspect. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Church of Rome appears, under Leo X, in all its power and
glory. A monk speaks, and over the half of Europe this power
and glory crumble away, thus reminding us of the words in which
the Son of God announces his second advent: "As the lightning
cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be." (Matth., xxiv, 27.)</p>

<p>This rapidity is inexplicable to those who see, in this great
event, only a <i>reform</i>, and regard it as simply an act of criticism,
which consisted in making a choice among doctrines, discarding
some, retaining others, and arranging those retained, so as to form
them into a new system.</p>

<p>How could a whole nation, how could several nations, have so
quickly performed an operation so laborious? How could this critical
examination have kindled that fire of enthusiasm which is
essential to great, and, above all, to rapid revolutions? The Reformation,
as its history will show, was altogether different. It
was a new effusion of the life which Christianity brought into the
world. It was the triumph of the greatest of doctrines, that which
animates those who embrace it with the purest and strongest
enthusiasm&mdash;the doctrine of faith, the doctrine of grace. Had the
Reformation been what many Catholics and many Protestants
in our day imagine,&mdash;had it been that negative system of negative
reason, which childishly rejects whatever displeases it, and
loses sight of the great ideas and great truths of Christianity, it
had never passed the narrow limits of an academy, a cloister, or a
cell. It had nothing in common with what is generally understood
by Protestantism. Far from being a worn-out, emaciated
body, it rose up like a man of might and fire.</p>

<p>Two considerations explain the rapidity and the extent of this
revolution. The one must be sought in God, the other among
men. The impulse was given by a mighty and invisible hand, and
the change effected was a Divine work. This is the conclusion
at which an impartial and attentive observer, who stops not at
the surface, necessarily arrives. But the historian's task is not
finished; for God works by second causes. A variety of circumstances,
many of them unperceived, gradually prepared men for
the great transformation of the sixteenth century, and, accordingly,
the human mind was ripe when the hour of its emancipation
pealed.</p>

<p>The task of the historian is to combine these two great elements
in the picture which he presents, and this has been attempted
in the present history. We shall be easily understood, when we
come to trace the second causes which contributed to the Reformation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
but some perhaps will not understand us so well, and will
even be tempted to tax us with superstition, when we attribute
the accomplishment of the work to God. The idea, however, is
particularly dear to us. This history, as indicated by the inscription
on its title-page, places in front and over its head the simple
and prolific principle, <span class="smcap">God in History</span>. But this principle being
generally neglected, and sometimes disputed, it seems necessary to
expound our views with regard to it, and thereby justify the method
which we have seen it proper to adopt.</p>

<p>History cannot, in our day, be that lifeless series of events which
the greater part of previous historians deemed it sufficient to
enumerate. It is now understood that in history as in man are
two elements, matter and spirit. Our great historians, unable to
satisfy themselves with a detail of facts, constituting only a barren
chronicle, have sought for a principle of life to animate the materials
of past ages.</p>

<p>Some have borrowed this principle from art, aiming at vivid,
faithful, and graphic description, and endeavouring to make their
narrative live with the life of the events themselves.</p>

<p>Others have applied to philosophy for the spirit which should
give fruit to their labours. To facts they have united speculative
views, instructive lessons, political and philosophical truths, enlivening
their narrative by the language which they have made it
speak, and the ideas which it has enabled them to suggest.</p>

<p>Both methods doubtless are good, and should be employed
within certain limits. But there is another source to which, above
all others, it is necessary to apply for the spirit and life of the past&mdash;I
mean Religion. History should be made to live with its own
proper life. God is this life. God must be acknowledged&mdash;God
proclaimed&mdash;in history. The history of the world should purport
to be annals of the government of the Supreme King.</p>

<p>I have descended into the field to which the narratives of our
historians invited me, and there seen the actions of men and of
states in energetic development and violent collision: of the clang
of arms, I have heard more than I can tell; but no where have I
been shown the majestic form of the Judge who sits umpire of the
combat.</p>

<p>And yet in all the movements of nations, there is a living principle
which emanates from God. God is present on the vast stage
on which the generations of men successively appear. True! He
is there a God invisible; but if the profane multitude pass carelessly
by, because He is concealed, profound intellects, spirits which
feel a longing for the principle of their existence, seek him with so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
much the more earnestness, and are not satisfied until they are
prostrated before Him. And their enquiries are magnificently
rewarded. For, from the heights which they must reach in order
to meet with God, the history of the world, instead of exhibiting to
them, as to the ignorant crowd, a confused chaos, is seen like a
majestic temple, on which the invisible hand of God himself is at
work, and which, from humanity, as the rock on which it is
founded, is rising up to his glory.</p>

<p>Shall we not see God in those great phenomena, those great personages,
those great states, which rise, and suddenly, so to speak,
spring from the dust of the earth, giving to human life a new impulse,
form, and destiny? Shall not we see Him in those great
heroes who start up in society, at particular epochs, displaying an
activity and a power beyond the ordinary limits of man, and around
whom individuals and nations come without hesitation, and group
themselves as around a higher and mysterious nature? Who flung
forward into space those comets of gigantic form and fiery tail,
which only appear at long intervals, shedding on the superstitious
herd of mortals either plenty and gladness, or pestilence and terror?
Who, if not God?... Alexander seeks his origin in the
abodes of Divinity; and in the most irreligious age there is no
great renown which strives not to connect itself in some way with
heaven.</p>

<p>And do not those revolutions, which cast down dynasties, or
even whole kingdoms into the dust; those huge wrecks which we
fall in with in the midst of the sands; those majestic ruins which
the field of humanity presents, do not those cry loud enough, God
in History? Gibbon, sitting amid the wrecks of the Capitol, and
contemplating the venerable ruins, acknowledges the intervention
of a higher power. He sees, he feels it, and in vain would turn
away from it. This spectre of a mysterious power reappears behind
each ruin, and he conceives the idea of describing its influence in
the history of the disorganisation, the decline and fall of this Roman
power, which had subjugated the nations. This powerful
hand, which a man of distinguished genius, one, however, who had
not bent the knee before Jesus Christ, perceives athwart scattered
fragments of the tomb of Romulus, reliefs of Marcus Aurelius, busts
of Cicero and Virgil, statues of Cæsar and Augustus, trophies of
Trajan, and steeds of Pompey, shall not we discover amid all
ruins, and recognise as the hand of our God?</p>

<p>Strange! this interposition of God in human affairs, which even
Pagans had recognised, men reared amid the grand ideas of Christianity
treat as superstition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>The name which Grecian antiquity gave to the Sovereign God,
shows us that it had received primitive revelations of this great
truth of a God, the source of history, and of the life of nations.
It called him <i>Zeus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that is to say, He who gives <i>life</i> to all that
lives, to individuals and nations. To his altars kings and subjects
come to take their oaths, and from his mysterious inspirations
Minos and other legislators pretend to have received their laws.
Nay more, this great truth is figured by one of the most beautiful
myths of Pagan antiquity. Even Mythology might teach the
sages of our day. This is a fact which it may be worth while to
establish; perhaps there are individuals who will oppose fewer
prejudices to the lessons of Paganism than to those of Christianity.
This Zeus, then, this Sovereign God, this Eternal Spirit, the principle
of life, is father of Clio, the Muse of History, whose mother
is Mnemosyne or Memory. Thus, according to antiquity, history
unites a celestial to a terrestrial nature. She is daughter of God
and man. But, alas! the short-sighted wisdom of our boasted
days is far below those heights of Pagan wisdom. History has
been robbed of her divine parent, and now an illegitimate child, a
bold adventurer, she roams the world, not well knowing whence she
comes, or whither she goes.</p>

<p>But this divinity of Pagan antiquity is only a dim reflection, a
flickering shadow of the Eternal Jehovah. The true God whom
the Hebrews worship, sees meet to imprint it on the minds of all
nations that he reigns perpetually on the earth, and for this purpose
gives, if I may so express it, a bodily form to this reign in the
midst of Israel. A visible Theocracy behoved for once to exist on
the earth, that it might incessantly recall the invisible Theocracy
which will govern the world for ever.</p>

<p>And what lustre does not the great truth&mdash;God in History&mdash;receive
from the Christian Dispensation? Who is Jesus Christ, if
he be not God in History? It was the discovery of Jesus Christ
that gave John Müller, the prince of modern historians, his knowledge
of history. "The Gospel," he says, "is the fulfilment of all
hopes, the finishing point of all philosophy, the explanation of all
revolutions, the key to all the apparent contradictions of the physical
and moral world; in short, life and immortality. Ever since I
knew the Saviour, I see all things clearly; with him there is no
difficulty which I cannot solve."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>So speaks this great historian; and, in truth, is not the fact of
God's appearance in human nature the key-stone of the arch, the
mysterious knot which binds up all the things of earth, and attaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
them to heaven? There is a birth of God in the history of the
world, and shall God not be in history? Jesus Christ is the true
God in the history of men. The very meanness of his appearance
proves it. When man wishes to erect a shade or shelter on the
earth, you may expect preparations, materials, scaffolding, workmen,
tools, trenches, rubbish. But God, when he is pleased to
do it, takes the smallest seed, which a new-born babe could have
clasped in its feeble hand, deposits it in the bosom of the earth,
and, from this grain, at first imperceptible, produces the immense
tree under which the families of the earth recline. To do great
things by imperceptible means is the law of God.</p>

<p>In Jesus Christ this law receives its most magnificent fulfilment.
Of Christianity, which has now taken possession of the portals
of nations, which is, at this moment, reigning or wandering over
all the tribes of the earth from the rising to the setting sun, and
which incredulous philosophy herself is obliged to acknowledge as
the spiritual and social law of the world&mdash;of this Christianity, (the
greatest thing under the vault of heaven, nay, in the boundless
immensity of Creation,) what was the commencement? An infant
born in the smallest town of the most despised nation of the earth&mdash;an
infant whose mother had not what the poorest and most
wretched female in any one of our cities has, a room for birth&mdash;an
infant born in a stable and laid in a manger!... There,
O God, I behold and I adore Thee!</p>

<p>The Reformation knew this law of God, and felt she had a
call to accomplish it. The idea that God is in history was often
brought forward by the Reformers. In particular, we find it on
one occasion expressed by Luther, under one of those grotesque
and familiar, yet not undignified figures which he was fond of
employing in order to be understood by the people. "The world,"
said he one day at table among his friends; "the world is a vast
and magnificent game at cards, consisting of emperors, kings, and
princes. For several ages the pope has beaten the emperors,
princes, and kings, who stooped and fell under him. Then our Lord
God came and dealt the cards, taking to himself the smallest,
[Luther,] and with it has beaten the pope, who beat the kings of
the earth.... God used it as his ace. 'He hath put down the
mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree,' says
Mary." (Luke, i, 52.)</p>

<p>The period whose history I am desirous to trace, is important
with reference to the present time. Man, on feeling his weakness,
is usually disposed to seek for aid in the institutions which
he sees existing around him, or in devices, the offspring of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
imagination. The history of the Reformation shows that nothing
new is done with what is old, and that if, according to our Saviour's
expression, there must be new vessels for new wine, there must
also be new wine for new vessels. It directs man to God, the sole
actor in history&mdash;to that divine Word&mdash;always ancient, from the
eternity of the truths which it contains&mdash;always new, by the regenerating
influence which it exerts, which three centuries ago purified
society, restoring faith in God to those whom superstition had
enfeebled; and which, at all epochs in the world's history, is the
source from which salvation proceeds.</p>

<p>It is singular to see a great number of individuals under the
agitation produced by a vague longing for some fixed belief, actually
applying to old Catholicism. In one sense, the movement is natural.
Religion being so little known, they imagine the only place to find
it is where they see it painted, in large characters, on a banner,
which age makes respectable. We say not that every kind of
Catholicism is incapable of giving man what he wants. Our belief
is, that a distinction should be carefully drawn between Catholicism
and the Papacy. The Papacy we hold to be an erroneous and destructive
system; but we are far from confounding Catholicism
with it. How many respectable men, how many true Christians
has not the Catholic Church contained! What immense services
did not Catholicism render to existing states on their first formation,
at a time when it was still strongly impregnated with the
Gospel, and when the Papacy was only sketched above it in faint
outline! But we are far away from those times. In our day an
attempt is made to yoke Catholicism to the Papacy; and if catholic
Christian truths are presented, they are little else than baits to
allure men into the nets of the hierarchy. There is nothing to be
expected from that quarter. Has the papacy abandoned one of its
practices, its doctrines, its pretensions? Will not this religion,
which other ages were unable to bear, be still less tolerable to ours?
What revival was ever seen to emanate from Rome? Is it from
the Papal hierarchy, all engrossed by earthly passions, that the
spirit of faith, hope, and charity, which alone will save us, can proceed?
Is it an effete system, which has no life for itself, which is
everywhere struggling with death, and exists only by aid borrowed
from without, that will give life to others, and animate Christian
society with the heavenly breath for which it sighs?</p>

<p>Or will this void in heart and soul, which some of our contemporaries
begin to feel, dispose others of them to apply to the new
Protestantism which has in several places supplanted the principal
doctrines taught in the days of the Apostles and Reformers?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
A great vagueness of doctrine reigns in many of those Reformed
Churches whose original members gave their blood as a seal of the
living faith which animated them. Men of distinguished talents,
alive to all that is beautiful in creation, have fallen into singular
aberrations. A general faith in the divinity of the Gospel is the
only standard which they are willing to follow. But what is this
Gospel? This is the essential question; and yet all are silent on
it, or, rather, each speaks in his own way. What avails it to
know that in the midst of the people stands a vessel placed there
by God in order to cure them, if none care for its contents, if none
endeavour to appropriate them? This system cannot fill up the
existing void. While the faith of the Apostles and Reformers is
now in all quarters displaying its activity and power in the conversion
of the world, this vague system does nothing, gives no
light, no life.</p>

<p>But let us not be without hope. Does not Roman Catholicism
confess the great doctrines of Christianity, God the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, Creator, Saviour, and Sanctifier, the Truth? Does
not vague Protestantism hold in its hand the Book of Life, which
is "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction
in righteousness?" And how many upright spirits, honourable
in the eyes of men, and pleasing in the sight of God, are
found among the followers of these two systems! How shall we
not love them?&mdash;how shall we not ardently desire their complete
emancipation from the elements of the world? Charity is of vast
extent; she takes the most opposite opinions into her embrace,
that she may bring them to the feet of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Already there are signs which show that these two extreme
opinions are in course of approximating to Jesus Christ, who is
the centre of truth. Are there not some Roman Catholic churches
in which the reading of the Scriptures is recommended and practised?
And, in regard to Protestant rationalism, how great the
advance which it has already made! It did not originate in the
Reformation, for the history of this great revolution will prove that
it was a time of faith; but may we not hope that it is tending
towards it? May not the force of truth reach it through the Word
of God, and, reaching, transform it? Even now it gives signs
of religious sentiment, inadequate, no doubt, but still forming an
approach towards sound doctrine, and giving hopes of decisive
progress.</p>

<p>Both Protestantism and old Catholicism are in themselves out
of the question, and off the field; and it must be from some other
source that the men of our day are to derive a saving power. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
must be something which comes not of man, but of God. "Give
me," said Archimedes, "a point outside the world, and I will
lift it from its poles." True Christianity is this point outside the
world. It lifts the human heart from the double pivot of egotism
and sensuality, and will one day lift the whole world from its
evil course, and make it turn on a new axis of righteousness and
peace.</p>

<p>Whenever religion is in question, three objects engage the attention&mdash;God,
man, and the priest. There can only be three religions
on the earth, according as God, man, or the priest, is the author
and head. By the religion of the priest, I mean that which is invented
by the priest for the glory of the priest, and is ruled over
by a sacerdotal caste. By the religion of man, I mean those
systems, those various opinions which human reason forms, and
which, created by man under disease, are, in consequence, utterly
devoid of power to cure him. By the religion of God, I mean the
truth as God himself has given it, having for its end and result the
glory of God and the salvation of men.</p>

<p>Hierarchism, or the religion of the priest, Christianity, or the
religion of God, rationalism, or the religion of man, are the three
systems which in our days share Christendom among them. There
is no safety either for man or for society in hierarchism and
rationalism. Christianity alone will give life to the world; but,
unhappily, of the three dominant systems it is not the one which
counts the greatest number of followers.</p>

<p>Followers, however, it has. Christianity is doing its work of
regeneration among many Catholics in Germany, and, doubtless,
in other countries also. In our opinion, it is accomplishing it more
purely and efficaciously among the evangelical Christians in Switzerland,
France, Great Britain, the United States, etc. Blessed be
God, the revivals, individual or social, which the Gospel produces,
are no longer in our day rare events, for which we must search in
ancient annals!</p>

<p>What I design to write, is a general history of the Reformation.
I purpose to follow its course among the different nations, and
to show that the same truths have everywhere produced the same
results; at the same time, pointing out the diversities occasioned
by differences of national character. And, first, it is in Germany
especially that we find the primitive type of reform. There it presents
the most regular development, there, above all, it bears the
character of a revolution not limited to this or that people, but
embracing the whole world. The Reformation in Germany is the
fundamental history of reform. It is the great planet; the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Reformations are secondary planets, which turn with it, lighted by
the same sun, and adapted to the same system, but still having a
separate existence, each shedding a different light, and always
possessing a peculiar beauty. To the Reformation of the sixteenth
century we may apply the words of St. Paul, "There is one glory
of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory." (1 Cor.,
xv, 41.) The Swiss Reformation took place at the same time
with that of Germany, and independently of it, and presented,
more especially at an after period, some of the grand features
which characterise the German Reformation. The Reformation in
England has very special claims on our attention, from the powerful
influence which the Church of that kingdom is now exercising
over the whole world. But recollections of family and of flight,
the thought of battles, sufferings, and exile endured for the cause of
the Reformation in France, give it, in my eyes, a peculiar attraction.
Considered in itself, and also in the date of its commencement,
it presents beauties of its own.</p>

<p>I believe that the Reformation is a work of God; this must have
been already seen. Still, I hope to be impartial in tracing its
history. Of the principal Roman Catholic actors in this great
drama&mdash;for example, of Leo X, Albert of Magdeburg, Charles V,
and Doctor Eck&mdash;I believe I have spoken more favourably than
the greater part of historians have done. On the other hand, I
have not sought to hide the faults and failings of the Reformers.</p>

<p>Since the winter of 1831-32, I have delivered public lectures on
the period of the Reformation, and I then published my opening
Address.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These lectures have served as a preparative for the
work which I now offer to the public.</p>

<p>This history has been drawn from sources made familiar to me
by long residence in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland,
and by the study, in the original tongues, of documents relating
to the religious history of Great Britain, and some other countries
besides. These sources are indicated by notes throughout the
work, and therefore require not to be mentioned here.</p>

<p>I could have wished to authenticate the different parts of my
narrative by numerous original notes, but found that, if long and
frequent, they might interrupt the course of the narrative in a
manner disagreeable to the reader. I have, therefore, confined
myself to certain passages which seemed fitted to make him more
thoroughly acquainted with subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>I address this history to those who love to see past events simply
as they were, and not by the help of the magic mirror of genius,
which magnifies and gilds, but sometimes also diminishes and distorts
them. Neither the philosophy of the eighteenth, nor the
romance of the nineteenth century, will furnish my opinions or my
colours. I write the history of the Reformation in its own spirit.
Principles, it has been said, have no modesty. Their nature is to
rule, and they doggedly insist on the privilege. If they meet in
their path with other principles which dispute their ascendancy,
they give battle instantly; for a principle never rests till it has
conquered. Nor can it be otherwise. To reign is its life; if it
reigns not, it dies. Hence, while declaring that I am not able,
and that I have no wish to rival other historians of the Reformation,
I make a reservation in favour of the principles on which
this history rests, and fearlessly maintain their superiority.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that as yet no history of the memorable
epoch which I am about to describe exists in French. When I
commenced my work, I saw no indication that the blank was to be
filled up. This circumstance alone could have induced me to
undertake the work, and I here bring it forward as my excuse.
The blank exists still; and I pray Him from whom every good
gift "cometh down" to grant that this humble attempt may not
be without benefit to some of its readers.</p>

<p>The enfeebled world was rocking on its base when Christianity
appeared. National religions which had sufficed for the fathers,
could no longer satisfy the children. The new generation could
not be moulded in the ancient forms. The gods of all nations
transported to Rome, had there lost their oracles, as the nations
had there lost their liberty. Brought face to face in the Capitol,
they had mutually destroyed each other, and their divinity had
disappeared. A great void had been made in the religion of the
world.</p>

<p>A kind of deism, destitute of spirit and life, kept floating, for
some time, over the abyss in which the vigorous superstitions of the
ancients were engulfed. But, like all negative beliefs, it was unable
to build. Narrow national distinctions fell with the gods, and the
nations melted down into one another. In Europe, Asia, and
Africa, there was now only one empire, and the human race began
to feel its universality and its unity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Then the Word was made flesh.</p>

<p>God appeared among men, and as a man, "to save that which
was lost." In Jesus of Nazareth "dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily."</p>

<p>This is the greatest event in the annals of the world. Ancient
times had prepared it,&mdash;new times flow from it. It is their centre,
their bond, and their unity.</p>

<p>Thenceforth all the popular superstitions were without meaning,
and the slender remains which they had saved from the great
shipwreck of infidelity sank before the Majestic Sun of eternal
truth.</p>

<p>The Son of man lived thirty-three years here below, curing the
sick, instructing sinners, having no place where to lay his head,
yet displaying, in the depth of this humiliation, a grandeur, a holiness,
a power, and divinity, which the world had never known.
He suffered, died, rose again, and ascended to heaven. His disciples,
beginning at Jerusalem, traversed the empire and the world,
everywhere proclaiming their Master "the Author of eternal salvation."
From the heart of a nation, which stood aloof from all
nations, came forth a mercy which invited and embraced all.
A great number of Asiatics, Greeks, and Romans, till then led by
priests to the feet of dumb idols, believed the Word which suddenly
illumined the earth "like a sunbeam," as Eusebius expresses it.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
A breath of life began to move over this vast field of death. A
new people, a holy nation, was formed among men, and the
astonished world beheld, in the disciples of the Galilean, a purity,
a self-denial, a charity, a heroism, of which it had lost even the
idea.</p>

<p>Two principles, in particular, distinguished the new religion from
all the human systems which it drove before it. The one related
to the ministers of worship, the other to doctrine.</p>

<p>The ministers of Paganism were in a manner the gods whom those
human religions worshipped. The priests of Egypt, Gaul, Scythia,
Germany, Britain, and Hindostan, led the people so long, at least,
as the eyes of the people were unopened. Jesus Christ, no doubt,
established a ministry, but he did not found a particular priesthood.
He dethroned the living idols of the nations, destroyed
a proud hierarchy, took from man what man had taken from God,
and brought the soul again into immediate contact with the divine
source of truth, proclaiming himself sole Master and sole Mediator.&mdash;"One
is your Master, even Christ," said he; "and all ye are
brethren." (Matt., xxiii, 8.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>In regard to doctrine, human religions had taught that salvation
was of man. The religions of the earth had framed an earthly
religion. They had told man that heaven would be given him as a
hire&mdash;they had fixed its price, and what a price! The religion of
God taught that salvation came from God, was a gift from heaven,
the result of an amnesty, of an act of grace by the Sovereign.
"God," it is said, "has given eternal life."</p>

<p>It is true, Christianity cannot be summed up under these two
heads, but they seem to rule the subject, especially where history
is concerned; and as we cannot possibly trace the opposition between
truth and error, in all points, we must select those of them
which are most prominent.</p>

<p>Such, then, were two of the constituent principles of the religion
which at that time took possession of the empire, and of the world.
<i>With</i> them we are within the true land-marks of Christianity&mdash;<i>out
of</i> them Christianity disappears. On the preservation or the loss
of them depended its greatness or its fall. They are intimately
connected; for it is impossible to exalt the priests of the church, or
the works of believers, without lowering Jesus Christ in his double
capacity of Mediator and Redeemer. The one of these principles
should rule the history of religion, the other should rule its doctrine.
Originally, both were paramount; let us see how they were lost.
We begin with the destinies of the former.</p>

<p>The Church was at first a society of brethren, under the guidance
of brethren. They were all taught of God, and each was entitled
to come to the Divine fountain of light, and draw for himself.
(John, vi, 45.) The Epistles, which then decided great questions
of doctrine, were not inscribed with the pompous name of a single
man&mdash;a head. The Holy Scriptures inform us, that the words
were simply these, "The apostles, elders, and brethren, to our
brethren." (Acts, xv, 23.)</p>

<p>But even the writings of the apostles intimate, that from the
midst of these brethren a power would rise and subvert this simple
and primitive order. (2 Thess., ii, 2.)</p>

<p>Let us contemplate the formation, and follow the development of
this power&mdash;a power foreign to the Church.</p>

<p>Paul of Tarsus, one of the greatest apostles of the new religion,
had arrived at Rome, the capital of the empire and of the world,
preaching the salvation which comes from God. A church was
formed beside the throne of the Cæsars. Founded by this apostle,
it consisted at first of some converted Jews, some Greeks, and
some citizens of Rome. For a long time it shone like a pure light
on a mountain top. Its faith was everywhere spoken of; but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
length it fell away from its primitive condition. It was by small
beginnings that the two Romes paved their way to the usurped
dominion of the world.</p>

<p>The first pastors or bishops of Rome early engaged in the
conversion of the villages and towns around the city. The necessity
which the bishops and pastors of the Campagna di Roma felt
of recurring in cases of difficulty to an enlightened guide, and
the gratitude which they owed to the Church of the metropolis,
led them to remain in close union with it. What has always been
seen in analogous circumstances was seen here; this natural union
soon degenerated into dependence. The superiority which the
neighbouring churches had freely yielded, the bishops of Rome
regarded as a right. The encroachments of power form one large
part of history, while the resistance of those whose rights were
invaded forms the other. Ecclesiastical power could not escape the
intoxication which prompts all those who are raised to aim at
rising still higher. It yielded to this law of humanity and nature.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the supremacy of the Roman bishop was at this
time limited to oversight of the churches within the territory civilly
subject to the prefect of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But the rank which this city of
the Emperors held in the world, presented to the ambition of its
first pastor a larger destiny. The respect paid in the second
century to the different bishops of Christendom was proportioned
to the rank of the city in which they resided. Now Rome was
the greatest, the richest, and the most powerful city in the world.
It was the seat of Empire,&mdash;the mother of nations; "All the inhabitants
of the earth belong to it," says Julian;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Claudian proclaims
it "the fountain of law."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>If Rome is queen of the cities of the world, why should not its
pastor be the king of bishops? Why should not the Roman Church
be the mother of Christendom? Why should not the nations
be her children, and her authority their sovereign law? It was easy
for the ambitious heart of man to reason in this way. Ambitious
Rome did so.</p>

<p>Thus Pagan Rome, when she fell, sent the proud titles which
her invincible sword had conquered from the nations of the earth to
the humble minister of the God of peace seated amidst her ruins.</p>

<p>The bishops in the different quarters of the empire, led away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by the charm which Rome had for ages exercised over all nations,
followed the example of the Campagna di Roma, and lent a hand
to this work of usurpation. They took pleasure in paying to the
Bishop of Rome somewhat of the honour which belonged to the
Queen city of the world. At first there was no dependence implied
in this honour. They treated the Roman pastor as equal
does equal;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but usurped powers grow like avalanches. What was
at first mere brotherly advice soon became, in the mouth of the
Pontiff, obligatory command. In his eyes a first place among
equals was a throne.</p>

<p>The Western bishops favoured the designs of the pastors of
Rome, either from jealousy of the Eastern bishops or because they
preferred the supremacy of a pope to the domination of a temporal
power.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the theological factions which rent the East
sought, each in its turn, to gain the favour of Rome, anticipating
their triumph from the support of the principal Church of the
West.</p>

<p>Rome carefully registered these requests, these mediations, and
smiled when she saw the nations throwing themselves into her
arms. She let slip no occasion of increasing and extending her
power. Praise, flattery, extravagant compliments, consultation
by other churches, all became, in her eyes, and in her hands, titles
and evidents of her authority. Such is man upon the throne; incense
intoxicates him, and his head turns. What he has he
regards as a motive to strive for more.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Church, and of the necessity of her external
unity, which began to prevail so early as the third century, favoured
the pretensions of Rome. The primary idea of the Church
is, that it is the assembly of the saints, (1 Cor., i, 2,) the assembly
of the first-born whose names are written in heaven. (Heb.,
xii, 23.) Still, however, the Church of the Lord is not merely
internal and invisible. It must manifest itself outwardly, and it
was with a view to this manifestation that the Lord instituted the
Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist. The Church considered
as external, has characteristics different from those which
distinguish her as the Church invisible. The internal Church,
which is the body of Christ, is necessarily and perpetually one.
The visible Church, doubtless, has part in this unity, but considered
in herself, multiplicity is a characteristic attributed to her
in the Scriptures of the New Testament. While they speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
us of a Church of God,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> they mention, when speaking of the
Church, as externally manifested, "the Churches of Galatia,"
"the Churches of Macedonia," "the Churches of Judea," "all the
Churches of the Saints."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> These different Churches, unquestionably,
may to a certain extent cultivate external union; but though
this tie be wanting, they lose none of the essential qualities of the
Church of Christ. In primitive times, the great tie which united
the members of the Church was the living faith of the heart, by
which all held of Christ as their common Head.</p>

<p>Various circumstances early contributed to originate and develop
the idea of the necessity of an external unity. Men accustomed
to the ties and political forms of an earthly country,
transferred some of their views and customs to the spiritual and
eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ. Persecution, powerless to destroy,
or even to shake this new society, drew its attention more
upon itself, and caused it to assume the form of a more compact
incorporation. To the error which sprung up in deistical schools,
or among sects, was opposed the one universal truth received
from the Apostles, and preserved in the Church. This was well,
so long as the invisible and spiritual Church was one with the
visible and external Church. But a serious divorce soon took
place; the form and the life separated from each other. The
semblance of an identical and external organisation was gradually
substituted for the internal and spiritual unity which forms the
essence of genuine religion. The precious perfume of faith was
left out, and then men prostrated themselves before the empty
vase which had contained it. The faith of the heart no longer
uniting the members of the Church, another tie was sought, and
they were united by means of bishops, archbishops, popes, mitres,
ceremonies, and canons. The living Church having gradually retired
into the hidden sanctuary of some solitary souls, the external
Church was put in its place, and declared to be, with all its forms,
of divine institution. Salvation, no longer welling up from the
henceforth hidden Word, it was maintained that it was transmitted
by means of the forms which had been devised, and that
no man could possess it if he did not receive it through this channel.
None, it was said, can, by his own faith, attain to eternal
life. Christ communicated to the Apostles, and the Apostles communicated
to the Bishops, the unction of the Holy Spirit; and
this Spirit exists nowhere but in that order! Originally, whosoever
had the Spirit of Jesus Christ was a member of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but the terms were now reversed, and it was maintained that none
but members of the Church received the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In proportion as these ideas gained ground, the distinction
between clergy and people became more marked. The salvation
of souls no longer depended solely on faith in Christ, but also,
and more especially, on union with the Church. The representatives
and heads of the Church obtained a part of the confidence
due only to Jesus Christ, and in fact became mediators for the
flock. The idea of the universal priesthood of Christians accordingly
disappeared step by step; the servants of the Church of
Christ were likened to the priests under the Old Dispensation;
and those who separated from the bishop were put in the same
class with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. From an individual
priesthood, such as was then formed in the Church, to a sovereign
priesthood, such as Rome now claims, the step was easy.</p>

<p>In fact, as soon as the error as to the necessity of a visible
unity of the Church was established, a new error was seen to arise,
viz., that of the necessity of an external representative of this
unity.</p>

<p>Although we nowhere find in the gospel any traces of a pre-eminence
in St. Peter over the other apostles; although the very idea
of primacy is opposed to the fraternal relations which united the
disciples, and even to the spirit of the gospel dispensation, which,
on the contrary, calls upon all the children of the Father to be
servants one to another, recognising one only teacher, and one
only chief; and although Jesus Christ sharply rebuked his disciples,
as often as ambitious ideas of pre-eminence arose in their carnal
hearts, men invented, and by means of passages of Scripture ill
understood, supported a primacy in St. Peter, and then in this
apostle, and his pretended successors at Rome, saluted the visible
representatives of visible unity&mdash;the heads of the Church!</p>

<p>The patriarchal constitution also contributed to the rise of
the Roman Papacy. So early as the three first centuries, the
churches of metropolitan towns had enjoyed particular respect.
The Council of Nice, in its Sixth Canon, singled out three cities,
whose churches had, according to it, an ancient authority over
those of the surrounding provinces; these were Alexandria, Rome,
and Antioch. The political origin of this distinction is betrayed
by the very name which was at first given to the bishop of these
cities. He was called Exarch, in the same way as the civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
governor.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At a later period, the more ecclesiastical name of Patriarch
was given to him. This name occurs for the first time in the
Council of Constantinople, but in a different sense from that which
it received at a later period; for it was only a short time before the
Council of Chalcedon, that it was applied exclusively to the great
metropolitans. The second ecumenical Council created a new patriarchate,
that of Constantinople itself, the new Rome, the second
capital of the empire. The Church of Byzantium, so long in obscurity,
enjoyed the same privileges, and was put by the Council of Chalcedon
in the same rank as the Church of Rome. Rome then
shared the patriarchate with these three churches; but when the invasion
of Mahomet annihilated the sees of Alexandria and Antioch&mdash;when
the see of Constantinople decayed, and later, even separated
from the west, Rome remained alone, and circumstances rallied
all around her see, which from that time remained without a rival.</p>

<p>New accomplices, the most powerful of all accomplices, came
also to her aid. Ignorance and superstition seized upon the
Church, and gave her up to Rome with a bandage on her eyes,
and chains on her hands. Still this slavery was not completed without
opposition. Often did the voice of the churches protest their
independence: This bold voice was heard especially in proconsular
Africa and the East.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But Rome found new allies to stifle the cry of the Churches.
Princes, whom tempestuous times often caused to totter on the
throne, offered her their support if she would in return support
them. They offered her spiritual authority, provided she would reinstate
them in secular power. They gave her a cheap bargain
of souls, in the hope that she would help them to a cheap bargain
of their enemies. The hierarchical power which was rising, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the imperial power which was declining, thus supported each
other, and, by this alliance, hastened their double destiny.</p>

<p>Here Rome could not be a loser. An edict of Theodosius II,
and of Valentinian III, proclaimed the bishop of Rome "Rector
of the whole Church."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Justinian issued a similar edict. These
decrees did not contain all that the popes pretended to see in
them; but in those times of ignorance it was easy for them to
give prevalence to the interpretation which was most in their
favour. The power of the emperors in Italy becoming always
more precarious, the Bishops of Rome failed not to avail themselves
of the circumstance to shake off their dependence.</p>

<p>But energetic promoters of the Papal power had by this time
emerged from the forests of the North. The barbarians, who had
invaded the West, and there fixed their abode, after intoxicating
themselves with blood and rapine, behoved to lower their fierce
sword before the intellectual, power which they encountered. Altogether
new to Christianity, ignorant of the spiritual nature of
the Church, and requiring in religion a certain external show,
they prostrated themselves, half savages, and half Pagans, before
the High Priest of Rome. With them the West was at his feet.
First, the Vandals, then the Ostrogoths, a little later the Burgundians,
afterwards the Visigoths, lastly, the Lombards and
Anglo-Saxons, came to do obeisance to the Roman Pontiff. It
was the robust shoulders of the sons of the idolatrous North
which finished the work of placing a pastor of the banks of the
Tiber on the supreme throne of Christendom.</p>

<p>These things took place in the West at the beginning of the
seventh century, precisely at the same period when the power
of Mahomet, ready also to seize on a portion of the globe, was
rising in the East.</p>

<p>From that time the evil ceases not to grow. In the eighth
century we see the Bishops of Rome with one hand repulsing the
Greek Emperors, their lawful sovereigns, and seeking to chase
them from Italy, while, with the other, they caress the Mayors of
France, and ask this new power, which is beginning to rise in the
West, for a share in the wrecks of the empire. Between the East,
which she repels, and the West, which she invites, Rome establishes
her usurped authority. She rears her throne between two
revolts. Frightened at the cry of the Arabs, who, become masters
of Spain, vaunt that they will soon arrive in Italy by the
passes of the Pyrennees and the Alps, and proclaim the name of
Mahomet on the seven hills&mdash;amazed at the audacious Astolphus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
who, at the head of his Lombards, sends forth his lion-roar, and
brandishes his sword before the gates of the eternal city, threatening
massacre to every Roman,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;Rome, on the brink of ruin,
looks around in terror, and throws herself into the arms of the
Franks. The usurper Pepin asks a pretended sanction to his new
royalty; the Papacy gives it to him, and gets him in return to
declare himself the defender of the "Republic of God." Pepin
wrests from the Lombards what they had wrested from the emperor;
but, instead of restoring it to him, he deposits the keys of
the towns which he has conquered on the altar of St. Peter, and,
swearing with uplifted hand, declares that it was not for a man
he took up arms, but to obtain the forgiveness of his sins from
God, and do homage to St. Peter for his conquests.</p>

<p>Charlemagne appears. The first time, he goes up to the Cathedral
of St. Peter devoutly kissing the steps. When he presents
himself a second time, it is as master of all the kingdoms which
formed the empire of the West, and of Rome herself.</p>

<p>Leo III deems it his duty to give the title to him who already
has the power, and, in the year 800, at the feast of Noel, places
on the head of the son of Pepin the crown of the Emperor of
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> From that time the pope belongs to the empire of the
Franks, and his relations with the East are ended. He detaches
himself from a rotten tree which is about to fall, in order to engraft
himself on a vigorous wild stock. Among the Germanic
races, to which he devotes himself, a destiny awaits him to which
he had never ventured to aspire.</p>

<p>Charlemagne bequeathed to his feeble successors only the wrecks
of his empire. In the ninth century civil power being everywhere
weakened by disunion, Rome perceived that now was the moment
for her to lift her head. When could the Church better
make herself independent of the State than at this period of decline,
when the crown which Charles wore was broken, and its
fragments lay scattered on the soil of his ancient empire?</p>

<p>At this time the spurious Decretals of Isidore appeared. In
this collection of pretended decrees of the popes, the most ancient
bishops, the contemporaries of Tacitus and Quintilian, spoke the
barbarous Latin of the ninth century. The customs and constitutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Franks were gravely attributed to the Romans
of the time of the emperors; popes quoted the Bible in the
Latin translation of St. Jerome, who lived one, two, or three
centuries after them; and Victor, Bishop of Rome, in the year
192, wrote to Theophilus, who was Archbishop of Alexandria, in
395. The impostor, who had forged this collection, strove to
make out that all the bishops derived their authority from the
Bishop of Rome, who derived his immediately from Jesus Christ.
Not only did he record all the successive conquests of the pontiffs,
but he, moreover, carried them back to the remotest periods. The
popes were not ashamed to avail themselves of this despicable invention.
As early as 865, Nicholas I selected it as his armour<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
to combat princes and bishops. This shameless forgery was for
ages the arsenal of Rome.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the vices and crimes of the pontiffs were for
some time to suspend the effects of the Decretals. The Papacy
celebrates its admission to the table of kings, by shameful libations.
It proceeds to intoxicate itself, and its head turns amidst
the debauch. It is about this time that tradition places upon the
Papal throne a damsel named Joan, who had fled to Rome with
her lover, and, being taken in labour, betrayed her sex in the
middle of a solemn procession. But let us not unnecessarily
aggravate the disgrace of the Court of the Roman Pontiffs.
Abandoned females did reign in Rome at this period. A throne,
which pretended to exalt itself above the majesty of kings, grovelled
in the mire of vice. Theodora and Marozia, at will, installed
and deposed the pretended Masters of the Church of Christ,
and placed upon the throne of Peter their paramours, their sons,
and their grandsons. These scandalous proceedings, which are
but too true, perhaps, gave rise to the tradition of Popess Joan.</p>

<p>Rome becomes a vast theatre of disorder, on which the most
powerful families in Italy contend for ascendancy&mdash;the Counts of
Tuscany usually proving victorious. In 1033, this house dares to
place upon the pontifical throne, under the name of Benedict the
Ninth, a young boy brought up in debauchery. This child of
twelve, when pope, continues his ineffable turpitude.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A faction
elects Sylvester in his stead, and at length Pope Benedict, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
conscience loaded with adultery, and a hand dyed with the blood of
murders,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> sells the popedom to an ecclesiastic of Rome.</p>

<p>The Emperors of Germany, indignant at so many disorders,
cleansed Rome with the sword. The empire, exercising its rights
of superiority, drew the triple crown out of the mire into which
it had fallen, and saved the degraded popedom by giving it decent
men for heads. Henry III, in 1046, deposed three popes,
and his finger, adorned with the ring of the Roman Patricians,
pointed out the bishop to whom the keys of the confession of
St. Peter were to be remitted. Four popes, all Germans, and nominated
by the emperor, succeeded each other. When the pontiff
of Rome died, deputies from that Church appeared at the imperial
court, like the envoys from other dioceses, to request a new
bishop. The emperor was even glad to see the pope reforming
abuses, strengthening the Church, holding councils, inducting and
deposing prelates, in spite of foreign monarchs; the Papacy, by
these pretensions, only exalted the power of the emperor, its liege
lord. But there was great danger in allowing such games to be
played. The strength which the popes were thus resuming, by
degrees, might be turned, all at once, against the emperor himself.
When the viper recovered, it might sting the bosom which
warmed it. This was what actually happened.</p>

<p>Here a new epoch in the Papacy begins. It starts up from its
humiliation, and soon has the princes of the earth at its feet. To
exalt it is to exalt the Church, is to aggrandise religion, is to
secure to the mind its victory over the flesh, and to God his
triumph over the world. These are its maxims, and in these ambition
finds its profit, fanaticism its excuse.</p>

<p>The whole of this new tendency is personified in one man,&mdash;Hildebrand.</p>

<p>Hildebrand, by turns unduly extolled or unjustly stigmatised, is
the personification of the Roman pontificate in its power and
glory. He is one of those master spirits of history, which contain
in them an entire order of new things, similar to those
presented in other spheres by Charlemagne, Luther, and Napoleon.</p>

<p>Leo IX took up this monk in passing through Clugny, and
carried him to Rome. From that time Hildebrand was the soul
of the popedom, until he became the popedom itself. He governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the Church in the name of several pontiffs before his own reign
under that of Gregory VII. One great idea took possession of
this great genius. He wishes to found a visible theocracy of which
the pope, as vicar of Jesus Christ, will be head. The remembrance
of the ancient universal dominion of Pagan Rome haunts his
imagination, and animates his zeal. He wishes to restore to Papal
Rome all that the Rome of the Emperors had lost. "What Marius
and Cæsar," said his flatterers, "could not do by torrents of blood,
thou performest by a word."</p>

<p>Gregory VII was not led by the Spirit of the Lord. To this
Spirit of truth, humility, and meekness, he was a stranger. He
sacrificed what he knew to be true, when he judged it necessary
to his designs. In particular, he did so in the affair of Berenger.
But a spirit far superior to that of the common run of pontiffs, a
deep conviction of the justice of his cause, undoubtedly did animate
him. Bold, ambitious, and inflexible in his designs, he was, at the
same time, dexterous and supple in the employment of means to
ensure their success.</p>

<p>His first labour was to embody the militia of the Church, for he
behoved to make himself strong before he attacked the empire.
A Council held at Rome cut off pastors from their families, and
obliged them to belong entirely to the hierarchy. The law of
celibacy, conceived and executed under popes who were themselves
monks, changed the clergy into a kind of monastic order.
Gregory VII pretended to have over all the bishops and priests of
Christendom the same power which an abbot of Clugny had over
the order over which he presided. The legates of Hildebrand, comparing
themselves to the proconsuls of ancient Rome, traversed
the provinces to deprive pastors of their lawful wives, and if need
were, the pope himself stirred up the populace against married
ministers.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>But Gregory's main purpose was to shake Rome free of the
empire. This bold design he never would have ventured to conceive,
had not the dissensions which troubled the minority of
Henry IV, and the revolt of the German princes, favoured its
execution. The pope was then like one of the grandees of the
empire. Making common cause with the other great vassals, he
forms a party in the aristocratic interest, and then forbids all
ecclesiastics, under pain of excommunication, to receive investiture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to their benefices from the Emperor. He breaks the ancient ties
which unite churches and their pastors to the authority of the
prince, but it is to yoke all of them to the pontifical throne. His
aim is by a powerful hand to enchain priests, kings, and people,
and make the pope a universal monarch. It is Rome alone that
every priest must fear, in Rome alone that he must hope. The
kingdoms and princedoms of the earth are his domain, and all
kings must tremble before the thunder of the Jupiter of modern
Rome. Woe to him who resists! Subjects are loosed from their
oath of allegiance, the whole country is smitten with interdict, all
worship ceases, the churches are shut, and their bells are mute;
the sacraments are no longer administered, and the word of malediction
reaches even to the dead, to whom the earth, at the bidding
of a haughty pontiff, refuses the peace of the tomb.</p>

<p>The pope, who had been subject from the earliest days of his existence,
first to the Roman Emperors, then to the Frank Emperors,
and, lastly to the German Emperors, was now emancipated, and
walked, for the first time, their equal, if not, indeed, their master.
Gregory VII was, however, humbled in his turn; Rome was
taken, and Hildebrand obliged to flee. He died at Salerno, saying,
"I have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore die I in
exile."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Words thus uttered at the portals of the grave who will
presume to charge with hypocrisy?</p>

<p>The successors of Gregory, like soldiers who arrive after a great
victory, threw themselves, as conquerors, on the subjugated churches.
Spain, rescued from Islamism, Prussia, delivered from idols, fell
into the hands of the crowned priest. The crusades, which were
undertaken at his bidding, every where widened and increased his
authority. Those pious pilgrims, who had thought they saw saints
and angels guiding their armies, and who, after humbly entering
the walls of Jerusalem barefoot, burned the Jews in their synagogue,
and, with the blood of thousands of Saracens, deluged the spots to
which they had come, seeking the sacred footsteps of the Prince of
Peace, carried the name of pope into the East, where it had ceased
to be known from the time when he abandoned the supremacy of
the Greeks for that of the Franks.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what the armies of the Roman republic and of
the empire had not been able to do, the power of the Church accomplished.
The Germans brought to the feet of a bishop the tribute
which their ancestors had refused to the most powerful generals.
Their princes, on becoming emperors, thought they had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a crown from the popes, but the popes had given them a yoke.
The kingdoms of Christendom, previously subjected to the spiritual
power of Rome, now became its tributaries and serfs.</p>

<p>Thus every thing in the Church is changed.</p>

<p>At first it was a community of brethren, and now an absolute
monarchy is established in its bosom. All Christians were priests
of the living God, (1 Peter, ii, 9,) with humble pastors for their
guides; but a proud head has risen up in the midst of these pastors,
a mysterious mouth utters language full of haughtiness, a hand of
iron constrains all men, both small and great, rich and poor,
bond and slave, to take the stamp of its power. The holy and
primitive equality of souls before God is lost, and Christendom,
at the bidding of a man, is divided into two unequal camps&mdash;in
the one, a caste of priests who dare to usurp the name of Church,
and pretend to be invested in the eyes of the Lord with high privileges&mdash;in
the other, servile herds reduced to blind and passive
submission, a people gagged and swaddled, and given over to a
proud caste. Every tribe, language, and nation of Christendom,
fall under the domination of this spiritual king, who has received
power to conquer.</p>

<p>But, along with the principle which should rule the history
of Christianity was one which should rule its doctrine. The
grand idea of Christianity was the idea of grace, pardon, amnesty,
and the gift of eternal life. This idea supposed in man an
estrangement from God, and an impossibility on his part to reenter
into communion with a Being of infinite holiness. The
opposition between true and false doctrine cannot, it is true, be
entirely summed up in the question of salvation by faith, and
salvation by works. Still it is its most prominent feature, or
rather, salvation considered as coming from man is the creating
principle of all error and all abuse. The excesses produced by
this fundamental error led to the Reformation, and the profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of a contrary principle achieved it. This feature must stand prominently
out in an introduction to the history of the Reformation.
Salvation by grace, then, is the second characteristic which
essentially distinguished the religion of God from all human religions.
What had become of it? Had the Church kept this great
and primordial idea as a precious deposit? Let us follow its history.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, Asia, Greece, and Rome, in the
days of the first emperors, heard the glad tidings, "By grace are
ye saved through faith&mdash;it is the gift of God." (Ephes., ii, 8.)
At this voice of peace&mdash;at this gospel&mdash;at this powerful word&mdash;many
guilty souls believing were brought near to Him who is the
source of peace, and numerous Christian churches were formed in
the midst of the corrupt generation then existing.</p>

<p>But a great misapprehension soon arose as to the nature of saving
faith. Faith, according to St. Paul, is the means by which
the whole being of the believer&mdash;his intellect, his heart, and his
will&mdash;enter into possession of the salvation which the incarnation of
the Son of God has purchased for him. Jesus Christ is apprehended
by faith, and thenceforth becomes every thing for man, and in man.
He imparts a divine life to human nature; and man thus renewed,
disengaged from the power of selfishness and sin, has new affections,
and does new works. Faith (says Theology, in order to
express these ideas) is the subjective appropriation of the objective
work of Christ. If faith is not an appropriation of salvation,
it is nothing; the whole Christian economy is disturbed, the
sources of new life are sealed up, and Christianity is overturned
at its base.</p>

<p>Such was the actual result. The practical view being gradually
forgotten, faith soon became nothing more than what it still is
to many&mdash;an act of the understanding&mdash;a simple submission to
superior authority.</p>

<p>This first error necessarily led to a second. Faith being stripped
of its practical character, could not possibly be said to save alone.
Works no longer coming after it, behoved to be placed beside it,
and the doctrine that man is justified by faith and by works
gained a footing in the Church. To the Christian unity, which
includes under the same principle justification and works, grace
and law, doctrine and duty, succeeded the sad duality, which
makes religion and morality to be quite distinct,&mdash;a fatal error,
which separates things that cannot live unless united, and which,
putting the soul on one side, and the body on the other, causes
death. The words of the apostle, echoing through all ages, are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
flesh?" (Gal., iii, 3.)</p>

<p>Another great error arose to disturb the doctrine of grace. This
was Pelagianism. Pelagius maintained that human nature is not
fallen&mdash;that there is no hereditary corruption&mdash;and that man,
having received the power of doing good, has only to will it in
order to perform it.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> If goodness consists in certain external actions,
Pelagius is right. But if we look to the motives from which
those external actions proceed, we find in every part of man selfishness,
forgetfulness of God, pollution, and powerlessness. The
Pelagian doctrine, driven back from the Church by Augustine,
when it advanced with open front, soon presented a side view in
the shape of semi-Pelagianism, and under the mask of Augustinian
formulæ. This heresy spread over Christendom with astonishing
rapidity. The danger of the system appeared, above all, in this&mdash;by
placing goodness, not within, but without, it caused a great
value to be set on external works, on legal observances, and acts
of penance. The more of these men did, the holier they were;
they won heaven by them, and individuals were soon seen (a very
astonishing circumstance, certainly) who went farther in holiness
than was required. Pelagianism, at the same time that it corrupted
doctrine, strengthened the hierarchy; with the same hand
with which it lowered grace it elevated the Church; for grace is
of God, and the Church is of man.</p>

<p>The deeper our conviction that the whole world is guilty before
God, the more will we cleave to Jesus Christ as the only source
of grace. With such a view, how can we place the Church on a
level with him, since she is nothing but the whole body of persons
subject to the same natural misery? But, so soon as we attribute
to man a holiness of his own, all is changed, and ecclesiastics and
monks become the most natural medium of receiving the grace of
God. This was what happened after Pelagius. Salvation, taken
out of the hands of God, fell into the hands of priests, who put
themselves in the Lord's place. Souls thirsting for pardon behoved
no longer to look towards heaven, but towards the Church, and,
above all, towards its pretended head. To blinded minds, the
Pontiff of Rome was instead of God. Hence the greatness of the
popes and indescribable abuses. The evil went farther still. Pelagianism,
in maintaining that man may attain perfect sanctification,
pretended, likewise, that the merits of saints and martyrs might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
be applied to the Church. A particular virtue was even ascribed
to their intercession. They were addressed in prayer, their aid
was invoked in all the trials of life, and a real idolatry supplanted
the adoration of the true and living God.</p>

<p>Pelagianism, at the same time, multiplied rites and ceremonies.
Man imagining that he could, and that he ought, by good works,
to render himself worthy of grace, saw nothing better fitted to
merit it than outward worship. The law of ceremonies becoming
endlessly complicated, was soon held equal at least to the moral
law, and thus the conscience of Christians was burdened anew
with a yoke which had been declared intolerable in the times of
the apostles. (Acts, xv, 10.)</p>

<p>But what most of all deformed Christianity was the system of
penance which rose out of Pelagianism. Penance at first consisted
in certain public signs of repentance, which the Church
required of those whom she had excluded for scandal, and who
were desirous of being again received into her bosom.</p>

<p>By degrees, penance was extended to all sins, even the most
secret, and was considered as a kind of chastisement to which it
was necessary to submit, in order to acquire the pardon of God
through the absolution of priests.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical penance was thus confounded with Christian repentance,
without which there cannot be either justification or
sanctification.</p>

<p>Instead of expecting pardon from Christ only by faith, it was
expected chiefly from the Church by works of penance.</p>

<p>Great importance was attached to the outward marks of repentance,
tears, fastings, and macerations, while the internal renewal
of the heart, which alone constitutes true conversion, was forgotten.</p>

<p>As confession and works of penance are easier than the extirpation
of sin, and the abandonment of vice, many ceased to struggle
against the lusts of the flesh, deeming it better to supply their
place by means of certain macerations.</p>

<p>Works of penance substituted in lieu of the salvation of God
kept multiplying in the Church from the days of Tertullian in the
third century. The thing now deemed necessary was to fast, go
barefoot, and wear no linen, etc., or to quit house and home for
distant lands, or, better still, to renounce the world and embrace
the monastic state!</p>

<p>To all this were added, in the eleventh century, voluntary flagellations.
These, at a later period, became a real mania in Italy, which
at that time was violently agitated. Nobles and peasants, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and old, even children of five, go two and two by hundreds, thousands,
and tens of thousands, through villages, towns and cities,
with an apron tied round their waist, (their only clothing,) and
visit the churches in procession in the dead of winter. Armed with
a whip, they flagellate themselves without mercy, and the streets
resound with cries and groans, such as to force tears from those
who hear them.</p>

<p>Still long before the evil had reached this height, men felt the
oppression of the priests and sighed for deliverance. The priests
themselves had perceived, that if they did not apply a remedy,
their usurped power would be lost, and, therefore, they invented
the system of barter, so well known under the name of Indulgences.
What they said was this:&mdash;"You penitents are not
able to fulfil the tasks which are enjoined you? Well, then, we,
priests of God, and your pastors, will take the heavy burden on
ourselves. For a fast of seven weeks," says Regino, Abbot of
Prum, "there will be paid by a rich man twentypence, by one
less so tenpence, by the poor threepence, and so in like proportion
for other things."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Bold voices were raised against this traffic,
but in vain.</p>

<p>The pope soon discovered the advantages which he might draw
from these indulgences. In the thirteenth century, Alexander
Hales, the irrefragable doctor, invented a doctrine well fitted to
secure this vast resource to the Papacy, and a bull of Clement
VII declared it an article of faith. Jesus Christ, it was said, did
far more than was necessary to reconcile God to men; for that a
single drop of his blood would have sufficed; but he shed much
blood in order to found a treasury for his church, a treasury which
even eternity should not be able to exhaust. The supererogatory
merits of the saints, i. e. the value of the works which they did
beyond their obligation, served also to augment this treasury,
the custody and administration of which have been intrusted to
Christ's vicar upon earth, who applies to each sinner for the faults
committed after baptism these merits of Jesus Christ and the
saints according to the measure and quantity which his sins render
necessary. Who will venture to attack a practice whose
origin is so holy?</p>

<p>This inconceivable traffic soon extends, and becomes more complex.
The philosophers of Alexandria speak of a fire in which souls
are to be made pure. This philosophical opinion, which several
ancient doctors had adopted, Rome declared to be a doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Church. The pope, by a bull, annexed purgatory to his domain.
He decreed that man should there expiate what he might
not be able to expiate here below, but that indulgences could
deliver souls from that intermediate state in which their sins must
otherwise detain them. This dogma is expounded by Thomas
Aquinas in his famous theological Summa. Nothing was spared
to fill the mind with terror. The torments which the purifying fire
inflicts on those who become its victims were painted in dreadful
colours. Even at the present day, in many Catholic countries, we
see pictures exhibited in churches, or in the public streets, in which
poor souls in the midst of burning flames are calling in agony for
relief. Who could refuse the redemption money which, on falling
into the treasury of Rome, was to ransom the soul from such
sufferings?</p>

<p>In order to give regularity to this traffic, there was shortly after
drawn up (probably by John XXII,) the famous and scandalous
taxation of indulgences, of which there have been more than forty
editions.</p>

<p>Ears the least delicate would be offended were we to repeat all
the horrible things contained in it.</p>

<p>Incest will cost, if it is not known, five groschen, if known, six;
so much will be paid for murder, so much for infanticide, adultery,
perjury, house-breaking, etc. "Shame upon Rome," exclaims
Claudius Esperse, a Roman theologian, and we add, Shame
upon human nature! for we cannot reproach Rome with anything
which does not recoil upon man himself. Rome is humanity
magnified in some of its evil propensities. We say this for the
sake of truth, and we also say it for the sake of justice.</p>

<p>Boniface VIII, the boldest and most ambitious of the popes
after Gregory VII, outstripped all his predecessors.</p>

<p>In the year 1300 he published a bull, by which he announced
to the Church, that every hundred years all persons repairing to
Rome would there obtain a plenary indulgence. Crowds flocked
from Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, France, Spain, Germany,
Hungary, and all quarters. Old men of sixty and seventy set out,
and there was counted at Rome in one month to the number of
two hundred thousand pilgrims. All these strangers bringing rich
offerings, the pope and the Romans saw their treasury filled.</p>

<p>Roman avarice soon fixed each jubilee at fifty years, next at
thirty-three, and at last at twenty-five. Then for the greater
convenience of buyers, and the greater profit of sellers, the jubilee
and its indulgences were transported from Rome to all parts of
Christendom. There was no occasion to leave home. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
others had gone to seek beyond the Alps, each might purchase at
his own door.</p>

<p>The evil could not go farther.</p>

<p>Then the Reformer arose.</p>

<p>We formerly saw what became of the principle which should
rule the history of Christianity, and we have now seen what became
of that which should rule its doctrine; both were lost.</p>

<p>To establish a mediating caste between man and God, and insist
that the salvation which God gives shall be purchased by works,
penances, and money, is the Papacy.</p>

<p>To give to all by Jesus Christ without a human mediator, and
without that power, which is called the Church, free access to the
great gift of eternal life, which God bestows on man, is Christianity
and the Reformation.</p>

<p>The Papacy is an immense wall raised between man and God
by the labour of ages. Whosoever would pass it must lay his
account with paying or suffering. And yet will it not be passed?</p>

<p>The Reformation is the power which threw down this wall, restored
Christ to man, and levelled the path by which he may come
to his Creator.</p>

<p>The Papacy interposes the Church between God and man.
Christianity and the Reformation make them meet face to face.
The Papacy separates&mdash;the Gospel unites them.</p>

<p>Having thus traced the history of the decay and extinction of
the two great principles which distinguish the religion of God from
all the religions of man, let us attend to some of the results of this
vast alteration.</p>

<p>First, however, let us pay some tribute of respect to this Church
of the middle ages which succeeded that of the Apostles and
Fathers, and preceded that of the Reformers. The Church, although
decayed, and always more and more enslaved, still was the
Church, that is to say, still remained the most powerful friend that
man possessed. Her hands, though tied, could still bless. During
those ages, great servants of Jesus Christ, men, who in essential
doctrines were true Protestants, shed a benign light, and in
the most humble convent or the most obscure parish, were found
poor monks and poor priests to solace deep griefs. The Catholic
Church was not the Papacy. The latter acted the part of oppressor,
the former that of the oppressed. The Reformation, which
declared war on the one came to deliver the other. And yet, truth
to tell, the Papacy itself was sometimes, in the hands of God, who
brings good out of evil, a necessary counterpoise to the power and
ambition of princes.</p>

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Religion&mdash;Relics&mdash;Easter Merriment&mdash;Manners&mdash;Corruption&mdash;Dissorderly Lives of
Priests, Bishops, and Popes&mdash;A Priest's Family&mdash;Education&mdash;Ignorance&mdash;Ciceronians.</p></blockquote>


<p>Let us now attend to the State of the Church before the Reformation.</p>

<p>The people of Christendom no longer expecting the gratuitous
gift of eternal life from the true and living God, it was necessary,
in order to obtain it, to have recourse to all the methods which a
superstitious, timid, and frightened conscience could invent.
Heaven is full of saints and mediators who can solicit the favour.
Earth is full of pious works, sacrifices, observances, and ceremonies,
which can merit it. Such is the picture of the religion of
this period, as drawn by one who was long a monk, and afterwards
a fellow-worker with Luther.</p>

<p>Myconius says, "The sufferings and merits of Christ were as
a vain tale, or as the Fables of Homer. Not a word was said of
the faith by which the righteousness of the Saviour, and the inheritance
of eternal life, are secured. Christ was a severe judge,
ready to condemn all who did not recur to the intercession of
saints, or the indulgences of popes. Instead of him there figured
as intercessors, first the Virgin Mary, like the Diana of Paganism,
and after her saints, of whom the popes were continually enlarging
the catalogue. These mediators gave the benefit of their prayers
only to those who had deserved well of the orders founded by them.
For this it was necessary to do not what God commands in his
word, but a great number of works which monks and priests
had devised, and which brought in large sums of money. These
were, Ave-Marias, prayers of St. Ursula, and St. Bridget. It was
necessary to chant and cry night and day. There were as many
places of pilgrimage as there were mountains, forests, or valleys.
But these toils might be bought off with money. Money, therefore,
and every thing that had any value, chickens, geese, ducks,
eggs, wax, straw, butter, and cheese, were brought to the convents
and to the priests. Then chants resounded, and bells
were rung, perfumes filled the sanctuary, and sacrifices were
offered; kitchens were stuffed, glasses rattled, and masses winding
up threw a cover over all these pious works. The bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
did not preach, but they consecrated priests, bells, monks,
churches, chapels, images, books, cemeteries, all these things yielding
large returns. Bones, arms, and feet, were presented in gold
and silver boxes. They were given out to be kissed during mass,
and this too yielded a large profit."</p>

<p>"All these folks maintained, that the pope being in the place of
God, (2 Thess., ii, 4,) could not be deceived, and they would not
hear of any thing to the contrary."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the Church of All Saints at Wittemberg were shown a piece
of Noah's Ark, a small portion of soot from the furnace of the
Three Young Men, a bit of the manger in which our Saviour was
laid, hair from the beard of the great Christopher, and nineteen
thousand other relics of greater or less value. At Schaffhausen was
shown the breath of St. Joseph, which Nicodemus had received
into his glove. In Wurtemberg, a vender of indulgences was seen
selling his wares, and having his head adorned with a large feather,
plucked from the wing of the archangel Michael.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But there was
no occasion to go to a distance in quest of these precious treasures.
Persons with hired relics travelled the country, and hawked them
about, as has since been done with the Holy Scriptures. The
faithful, having them thus brought to their houses, were spared
the trouble and expence of pilgrimage. Relics were exhibited with
great ceremony in the churches, while those travelling hawkers
paid a fixed sum to the owners, and also gave them so much per
centage on their returns. The kingdom of heaven had thus disappeared,
and men, to supply its place on the earth, had opened a
disgraceful traffic.</p>

<p>In this way, a profane spirit had invaded religion, and the most
sacred seasons of the Church, those which, most forcibly and
powerfully invited the faithful to self-examination and love, were
dishonoured by buffoonery and mere heathen blasphemies. The
"Easter Drolleries" held an important place in the acts of the
Church. As the festival of the resurrection required to be celebrated
with joy, every thing that could excite the laughter of the
hearers was sought out, and thrust into sermons. One preacher
imitated the note of the cuckoo, while another hissed like a goose.
One dragged forward to the altar a layman in a cassock; a second
told the most indecent stories; a third related the adventures of
the Apostle Peter, among others, how, in a tavern, he cheated
the host by not paying his score.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The inferior clergy took advantage
of the occasion to turn their superiors into ridicule. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
churches were thus turned into stages, and the priests into
mountebanks.</p>

<p>If such was the state of religion, what must that of morals have
been? It is true, and equity requires we should not forget, that,
at this time, corruption was not universal. Even when the Reformation
took place, much piety, righteousness, and religious vigour,
were brought to light. Of this, the mere sovereignty of God
was the cause; but still, how can it be denied, that He had previously
deposited the germs of this new life in the bosom of the
Church? In our own day, were all the immoralities and abominations
which are committed in a single country brought together,
the mass of corruption would undoubtedly fill us with alarm. Still
it is true, that, at this period, evil presented itself in a form, and
with a universality, which it has never had since. In particular,
the abomination of desolation was seen standing in the holy place,
to an extent which has not been permitted since the period of the
Reformation.</p>

<p>With faith morality had decayed. The glad tidings of eternal
life is the power of God for the regeneration of man. But take
away the salvation which God gives, and you take away purity of
heart and life. This was proved by the event.</p>

<p>The doctrine and the sale of indulgences operated on an ignorant
people as a powerful stimulus to evil. It is no doubt true,
that, according to the doctrine of the Church, indulgences were of
use only to those who promised to amend, and actually kept their
promise. But what was to be expected of a doctrine which had
been invented with a view to the profit which it might be made to
yield? The venders of indulgences, the better to dispose of their
wares, were naturally disposed to present them in the most winning
and seductive form. Even the learned were not too well informed
on the subject, while the only thing seen by the multitude
was, that indulgences gave them permission to sin. The merchants
were in no haste to disabuse them of an error so greatly in favour
of the trade.</p>

<p>In those ages of darkness, what disorders and crimes must have
prevailed when impunity could be purchased with money! What
ground could there be for fear when a trifling contribution to build
a church procured exemption from punishment in the world to
come! What hope of renovation, when all direct communication
between men and their God had ceased&mdash;when, estranged from
him, their spirit and life, they moved to and fro among frivolous
ceremonies and crude observances in an atmosphere of death!</p>

<p>The priests were the first to yield to the corrupting influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
In wishing to raise, they had lowered themselves. They had
tried to steal from God a ray of his glory, that they might place
it in their own bosom; but, instead of this, had only placed in it
some of the leaven of corruption, stolen from the Evil one. The
annals of the period teem with scandalous stories. In many
places people were pleased to see their priest keeping a mistress,
in the hope that it might secure their wives from seduction.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> How
humbling the scene which the house of such a priest must have
presented! The unhappy man maintained the woman and the
children she might have borne him, out of tithes and alms.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> His
conscience upbraided him. He blushed before his people, his servants,
and his God. The woman fearing, that, in the event of the
priest's death, she might become destitute, sometimes made provision
beforehand, and played the thief in her own house. Her
honour was gone, and her children were a living accusation against
her. Objects of universal contempt, both parties rushed into
quarrelling and dissipation. Such was the home of a priest!...
In these fearful scenes, the people read a lesson of which they
were not slow to avail themselves.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The rural districts became the theatre of numerous excesses.
The places where priests resided were often the abodes of dissoluteness.
Corneille Adrian at Bruges,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and Abbot Trinkler at Cappel,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
imitated the manners of the East, and had their harems. Priests
associating with low company, frequented taverns and played at
dice, crowning their orgies with quarrels and blasphemy.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The
Council of Schaffhausen issued an order forbidding priests to dance
in public except at marriages, or to carry more than one kind of
weapon. They, moreover, ordered that such priests as were found
in houses of bad fame should be stript of their cassocks.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In the
archbishopric of Mayence, they leapt the walls at night, and then
shouted and revelled in all sorts of debauchery within taverns
and inns. Doors and locks were not secure from their attacks.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
In several places, each priest was liable to the bishop in a certain
tax for the female he kept, and for every child she bore him. One
day, a German bishop, who was attending a great festival, openly
declared that in a single year, the number of priests who had been
brought before him for this purpose amounted to eleven thousand.
This account is given by Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><p>Among the higher orders of the priesthood, the corruption was
equally great. The dignitaries of the Church preferred the turmoil
of camps to chanting at the altar, and to take lance in hand, and
reduce those around them to obedience, was one of the first qualities
of a bishop. Baldwin of Tours, who was constantly warring
with his vassals and neighbours, razed their castles, built others of
his own, and thought of nothing but enlarging his territory. It is
told of a certain bishop of Eichstadt, that when he sat in his court,
he had a coat-of-mail under his gown, and a large sword in his hand.
One of his sayings was, that in fair fight he was not afraid of five
Bavarians.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The bishops and the inhabitants of the towns where
they resided were perpetually at war. The burghers demanded
freedom, while the priests insisted on absolute obedience. When
the latter proved victorious, they punished revolt, and satiated
their vengeance with numbers of victims; but the flame of insurrection
burst forth at the very moment when they imagined they
had suppressed it. And what a spectacle was presented by the pontifical
throne at the period immediately preceding the Reformation!
To say the truth, even Rome was not often witness to such
infamy.</p>

<p>Roderigo Borgia, after he had lived with a lady of Rome, continued
the same illegitimate intercourse with her daughter, Rosa
Vanozza, and had five children by her. This man, a cardinal and
an archbishop, was living at Rome with Vanozza, and other females
besides, frequenting churches and hospitals, when the pontifical
chair became vacant by the death of Innocent VIII. Borgia
secured it by buying each cardinal for a regular price. Four mules
loaded with gold publicly entered the palace of Cardinal Sforza,
the most influential among them. Borgia became Pope under the
name of Alexander VI, and was delighted at having thus reached
the pinnacle of pleasure.</p>

<p>On his coronation-day, he appointed his son Cæsar, a youth of
ferocious temper and dissolute habits, Archbishop of Valentia and
Bishop of Pampeluna. Then, when his daughter Lucretia was married,
he celebrated the occasion in the Vatican with fêtes which were
attended by his mistress, Julia Bella, and enlivened by comedies
and obscene songs. "All the ecclesiastics," says a historian,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
"had mistresses, and all the convents of the capital were houses
of bad fame." Cæsar Borgia espoused the faction of the Guelphs,
and when, by their assistance, he had destroyed the Ghibelins, he
turned round upon the Guelphs, and, in like manner, destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
them. But he was unwilling that any should share the spoil with
him, and, therefore, after Alexander had, in 1497, made his eldest
son Duke of Benevento, the Duke disappeared. George Schiavoni,
a dealer in wood on the banks of the Tiber, one night saw a
dead body thrown into the river, but said nothing; such occurrences
were common. The dead body proved to be that of the
Duke, who had been murdered by his brother Cæsar.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Nor was
this enough. Having taken offence at his brother-in-law, he
made him be stabbed on the stair of the pontifical palace. The
wounded man, covered with blood, was carried to his apartment,
where he was constantly watched by his wife and sister, who,
dreading Cæsar's poison, prepared his food with their own hands.
Alexander placed sentinels at his door, but Cæsar laughed at their
precautions, and as the pope was going to see his son-in-law, Cæsar
said to him, "What is not done at dinner will be done at supper."
In short, he one day forced his way into the room, drove out the
wife and sister, and calling in his executioner, Michilotto, the only
person to whom he showed any confidence, looked on while his
brother-in-law was strangled.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Alexander had a favourite, named
Peroto. The pope's partiality for him offended the young Duke.
He pursued him, and Peroto, taking refuge under the pontifical
mantle, clasped the pope in his arms. Cæsar stabbed him, and
the blood of his victim sprung into the pontiffs face.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "The
pope," adds a contemporary witness to these scenes, "loves his
son the Duke, and is much afraid of him." Cæsar was the handsomest
and most powerful man of his age. He fought with six
wild bulls, and despatched them with ease. Every morning at
Rome persons were found who had been assassinated during the
night, while poison carried off those whom the sword could not
reach. Men dared not to move or breathe in Rome, every one
trembling till his own turn should arrive. Cæsar Borgia was the
hero of crime. The spot of earth where iniquity attained this dreadful
height was the pontifical throne. When once man has given
himself over to the powers of darkness, the higher the station he
pretends to occupy in the sight of God, the deeper he sinks into
the abysses of hell. The dissolute fêtes which were given in the
pontifical palace by the pope, his son Cæsar, and his daughter
Lucretia, cannot be described, or even thought of, without horror.
The impure groves of antiquity, perhaps, never saw the like. Historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have accused Alexander and Lucretia of incest, but the
proof seems defective. The pope had prepared poison for a rich
cardinal, in a small box of comfits which were to be served after
a sumptuous repast. The cardinal being put on his guard, bribed
the steward, and the poisoned box was placed before Alexander,
who ate of it and died.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The whole city ran to see the dead viper,
and could not get enough of the sight.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Such was the man who occupied the pontifical see at the beginning
of the century in which the Reformation commenced.</p>

<p>The clergy having thus brought religion and themselves into
disrepute, a powerful voice might well exclaim, "The ecclesiastical
state is opposed to God and to his glory. The people well
know this, and but too well do they show it, by the many songs,
proverbs, and jests, against priests, which are current among the
lower classes, and by all those caricatures of monks and priests
which we see on all the walls, and even on playing cards. Every
man feels disgust when he sees or when he hears of an ecclesiastic."
These are Luther's words.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The evil had spread through all ranks. A spirit of error had
been sent to men, corruption of manners kept pace with corruption
of faith, and a mystery of iniquity lay like an incubus on the
enslaved Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>There was another consequence which necessarily resulted from
the oblivion into which the fundamental doctrine of the gospel
had fallen. Ignorance was the companion of corruption. The
priests having taken into their own hands the distribution of a salvation
which belongs only to God, deemed this a sufficient title to
the respect of the people. What occasion had they to study sacred
literature? Their business was not to expound the Scriptures, but
to give diplomas of indulgence&mdash;a ministry which called not for
the laborious acquisition of extensive knowledge.</p>

<p>In the rural districts, says Wimpheling, the persons selected for
preachers were miserable creatures, who had been previously
raised from beggary, cast-off cooks, musicians, huntsmen, grooms,
and still worse.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The higher clergy were often sunk in deep ignorance. A Bishop
of Dunfeld congratulated himself that he had never learned either
Greek or Hebrew, while the monks contended that all heresies
sprung out of these languages, and especially out of the Greek.
"The New Testament," said one of them, "is a book full of briers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and serpents. "The Greek," continued he, "is a new language
recently invented, and of it we ought specially to beware. As to
Hebrew, my dear brethren, it is certain that all who learn it, that
very instant become Jews." We quote from Heresbach, a friend
of Erasmus, and a respectable writer. Thomas Linacer, a learned
and celebrated ecclesiastic, had never read the New Testament.
In the last days of his life, (in 1524,) he caused a copy of it to be
brought, but immediately dashed it from him with an oath, because,
on opening it, he had lighted on these words, "I say unto
you, Swear not at all." Now he was a great swearer. "Either
this is not the gospel," said he, "or we are not Christians."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Even the Theological Faculty of Paris did not hesitate at this
time to say, in presence of the Parliament, "It is all over with
religion if the study of Greek and Hebrew is allowed." If, among
ecclesiastics, there were a scattered few who had made some attainments,
it was not in sacred literature. The Ciceronians of
Italy affected great contempt for the Bible because of its style.
Men calling themselves priests of the Church of Jesus Christ, translated
the writings of holy men inspired by the Spirit of God into
the style of Virgil and Horace, in order to adapt them to the ears
of good society. Cardinal Bembo, instead of <i>the Holy Spirit</i>,
wrote <i>the breath of the heavenly zephyr</i>; instead of to <i>forgive sins</i>,&mdash;to
<i>bend the manes and the Sovereign God</i>; and instead of <i>Christ
the Son of God</i>,&mdash;<i>Minerva sprung from the forehead of Jupiter</i>.
Having one day found the respectable Sadolet engaged in translating
the Epistle to the Romans, he said to him, "Leave off this
child's play; such trifling ill becomes a man of gravity."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Such are some of the consequences of the system under which
Christendom then groaned. Our picture, undoubtedly, proves
both the corruption of the Church and the necessity of a Reformation;
and it was this we proposed in sketching it. The vital
doctrines of Christianity had almost entirely disappeared, and with
them the light and life which constitute the essence of genuine
religion. The strength of the Church had been wasted, and its
body, enfeebled and exhausted, lay stretched almost without life,
over the whole extent which the Roman empire had occupied.</p>

Pope judged in Italy&mdash;Discoveries by Kings and Subjects&mdash;Frederick the Wise&mdash;His

<p>The evils which then afflicted Christendom, viz., superstition,
infidelity, ignorance, vain speculation, and corruption of manners&mdash;all
natural fruits of the human heart&mdash;were not new upon the
earth. Often had they figured in the history of states. In the
East, especially, various religions which had had their day of
glory, but had become enervated, had been attacked by them, and,
yielding to the assault, had fallen under it, never again to rise.
Is Christianity to experience the same fate? Will she be destroyed
like these ancient popular religions? Will the blow which gave
them death be strong enough to deprive her of life? Is there nothing
that can save her? Will those hostile powers that now oppress
her, and which have already overthrown so many other forms
of worship, be able to seat themselves without opposition on the
ruins of the Church of Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>No! There is in Christianity what there was not in any of
those popular religions. It does not, like them, present certain
abstract ideas, interwoven with traditions and fables, destined to
fall, sooner or later, under the attacks of human reason. It contains
pure truth, founded on facts capable of standing the scrutiny
of every upright and enlightened mind. Christianity does not
aim merely at exciting certain vague religious sentiments, which,
when they have once lost their charm, cannot be again revived.
Its end is to satisfy, and it, in fact, does satisfy, all the religious
wants of human nature, whatever the degree of refinement to
which it may have attained. It is not the work of man, whose
labours fade and are effaced; it is the work of God, who sustains
what he creates; and the pledge of its duration is the promise of
its divine Head.</p>

<p>It is impossible that human nature can ever rise so high as to
look down on Christianity, or if, for a time, human nature do
think herself able to dispense with it, it soon appears with renewed
youth and life, as alone fit for curing souls. Degenerate
nations then return with new ardour to those ancient, simple, and
powerful truths, which, in the hour of their infatuation, they had
turned from with disdain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Christianity, in fact, displayed in the sixteenth century the
same regenerating power which it had exerted in the first. After
fifteen centuries the same truths produced the same results. In
the days of the Reformation, as in those of Paul and Peter, the
Gospel, with invincible force, overthrew the mightiest obstacles.
Its sovereign power was manifested from north to south among
nations differing most widely from each other in manners, character,
and intellectual development. Then, as in the days of
Stephen and James, it lighted up the fire of enthusiasm and devotedness
in nations which seemed almost extinguished, and exalted
them even to the height of martyrdom.</p>

<p>How was this revival of the Church and of the world accomplished?</p>

<p>The observer might then have seen the operation of two laws
by which God governs the world at all times.</p>

<p>First, as He has ages to act in, he begins his preparations leisurely,
and long before the event which He designs to accomplish.</p>

<p>Then, when the time is come, he produces the greatest results
by the smallest means. It is thus he acts in nature and in history.
When he wishes an immense tree to grow, he deposits a
little grain in the earth; and, when he wishes to renew his Church,
he employs the humblest instrument to accomplish what emperors
and all the learned and eminent in the Church were unable to perform.
By and by we will search for and we will discover this little
seed which a Divine hand deposited in the earth in the days of the
Reformation; but at present, let us endeavour to ascertain the
various means by which God prepared this great event.</p>

<p>At the period when the Reformation was ready to burst forth,
Rome appeared to be in peace and safety. One would even have
said that nothing could disturb her triumph after the great victories
which she had gained. General Councils&mdash;those Upper and
Lower Houses of Catholicity&mdash;had been subdued. The Vaudois
and the Hussites had been suppressed. No University, with the
exception, perhaps, of that of Paris, which sometimes raised its
voice when its kings gave the signal, doubted the infallibility of
the oracles of Rome. Each seemed to have accepted his alloted
share in her power. The higher clergy deemed it better to give a
distant chief the tenth part of their revenues, and quietly consume
the other nine, than to hazard all for an independence which would
cost much and yield little. The lower clergy, decoyed by the
perspective of rich benefices, which ambition made them fancy
and discover in the distance, were willing, by a little slavery, to
realise the flattering hopes which they entertained. Besides, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were almost everywhere so oppressed by the chiefs of the hierarchy,
that they could scarcely struggle under their powerful grasp,
far less rise boldly and hold up their heads. The people knelt before
the Roman altar, and kings themselves, though they began
in secret to despise the Bishop of Rome, durst not venture to attack
his power with a hand which the age would have deemed
sacrilegious.</p>

<p>But opposition, if it seemed externally to have slackened, or
even ceased, when the Reformation burst forth, had more inward
strength. A nearer view of the edifice will disclose to us more
than one symptom which presaged its downfall. General Councils,
though vanquished, had diffused their principles throughout
the Church, and carried division into the enemy's camp. The
defenders of the hierarchy were divided into two parties, viz.,
those who maintained the system of absolute Papal domination,
on the principles of Hildebrand, and those who were desirous of
a constitutional Papal government, offering guarantees and giving
liberty to the churches.</p>

<p>Nor was this the whole. Faith in the infallibility of the Roman
bishop was greatly shaken among all parties; and, if no voice
was raised in opposition to it, it was because every one rather desired
anxiously to retain the little faith in it which he still had.
The least shock was dreaded, because it might overturn the edifice.
Christendom held in its breath; but it was to prevent a disaster
by which its own existence might have been endangered. From
the moment when man trembles at the thought of abandoning a
long venerated belief, it has lost its influence over him, and even
the appearance of respect which he may be desirous to keep up will
not be long maintained. The Reformation had been gradually prepared
in three different worlds&mdash;the political, the ecclesiastical,
and the literary. Political bodies, private Christians, and theologians,
the literary and the learned, all contributed to the revolution
of the sixteenth century. Let us take a survey of this
triple opposition, concluding with the literary class, though, at the
period immediately preceding the revolution, it was perhaps the
most powerful of all.</p>

<p>First, among political bodies, Rome had lost much of its ancient
credit. Of this the Church herself was the primary cause; for, properly
speaking, it was not the errors and superstitions which she
had introduced into Christianity that gave the fatal blow. Before
Christendom could have been able to condemn her on this account,
it must have stood higher than the Church, in respect of intellectual
and religious development. But there was a class of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which the laity well understood, and it was by these they judged
the Church. She had become of the "earth, earthy." The sacerdotal
empire, which tyrannised over the nations, existed solely by
the illusions of its subjects; and having a halo for its crown, had
forgotten its nature, and left heaven, with his spheres of light and
glory, to plunge into the vulgar interests of burghers and princes.
Though representing those who are born of the Spirit, the priests
had exchanged the Spirit for the flesh. They had abandoned the
treasures of knowledge, and the spiritual power of the Word, for
the brute force and tinkling of the age.</p>

<p>The thing happened naturally enough. At first the Church
pretended that her object was to defend spiritual order. But in
order to protect it from the opposition and assaults of the people,
she had resorted to earthly means, to vulgar weapons, which a
false prudence had induced her to take up. When the Church
had once begun to handle such weapons, her spirituality was at
an end. Her arm could not become temporal without rendering
her heart temporal also. The appearance presented soon became
the reverse of what it had been at the outset. At first she had
thought proper to employ the earth in defending heaven; now she
employed heaven to defend the earth. Theocratic forms became
in her hands merely a mean of accomplishing worldly interests.
The offerings which the people laid at the feet of the sovereign
pontiff of Christendom were expended in maintaining the luxury
of his court and the soldiers of his armies. His spiritual power
served him as a ladder on which to climb, and then put the
kings and nations of the earth under his feet. The charm broke,
and the power of the Church was lost as soon as the men of the
world could say, "She is become as one of us."</p>

<p>The great were the first to examine the titles of this imaginary
power.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This examination might, perhaps, have been sufficient to
overthrow Rome; but, happily for her, the education of princes
was everywhere in the hands of her adepts. These inspired their
august pupils with sentiments of veneration for the Roman pontiff.
The rulers of the people grew up within the sanctuary, and
princes of ordinary capacity could never entirely quit it. Several
even had no other ambition than to be found in it at the hour of
death. They preferred to die under a cassock rather than a crown.</p>

<p>Italy, that apple of discord in Europe, perhaps contributed most
to open the eyes of kings. Having occasion to communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with popes on matters which concerned the temporal prince of
the States of the Church, and not the Bishop of bishops, they
were greatly astonished when they saw them ready to sacrifice
rights which appertained to the pontiff, in order to secure certain
advantages to the prince. They discovered that these pretended
organs of truth had recourse to all the petty wiles of politics,
to deceit, dissimulation, and perjury.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Then, at length, the bandage,
which education had tied upon the eyes of princes, fell off.
Then wily Ferdinand of Arragon tried stratagem against stratagem.
Then the impetuous Louis XII caused a medal to be struck
with this inscription, "Perdam Babylonis nomen."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And honest
Maximilian of Austria, grieved to the heart on learning the
treachery of Leo X, declared openly, "Henceforth this pope,
too, is to me nothing better than a villain; now I can say that
throughout my life not one pope has kept faith with me, or been
true to his word. If it please God, I hope that this one will be the
last."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Kings and states began, moreover, to feel impatient under the
heavy burden which the popes imposed on them, and to demand
that Rome should free them from contributions and annats which
wasted their resources. Already had France opposed Rome
with the pragmatic sanction, and the heads of the empire claimed
to share in it. In 1511 the emperor took part in the Council of
Pisa, and had even at one time an idea of seizing the popedom
for himself. But, among the rulers of the people none were so
useful to the Reformation as the prince in whose states it was to
commence.</p>

<p>Of all the Electors of that period, the most powerful was Frederick
of Saxony, surnamed the Wise. Having succeeded, in 1487,
to the hereditary states of his family, he had received the electoral
dignity from the emperor, and in 1493 undertook a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem, where he was dubbed "Knight of the Holy Sepulchre."
His power and influence, his riches and liberality, raised him
above all his equals. God chose him to be the tree under whose
shelter the seed of truth might be able to push forth its first blade,
without being uprooted by storms from without.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>No man was better fitted for this noble service. Frederick possessed
the general esteem, and, in particular, had the entire confidence
of the emperor, whom he even represented in his absence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
His wisdom consisted not in the dexterous arts of a wily politician,
but in an enlightened and foreseeing prudence, the first maxim of
which was never to offer violence, from interested motives, to the
laws of honour and religion.</p>

<p>At the same time, he felt in his heart the power of the word
of God. One day when Staupitz, the Vicar-General, was with
him, the conversation turned upon those who entertained the people
with vain declamation. "All discourses," said the Elector, "which
are filled only with subtleties and human traditions, are wondrously
cold, nerveless, and feeble. It is impossible to advance one
subtlety which another subtlety cannot destroy. The Holy Scriptures
alone are clothed with such power and majesty, that, destroying
all our learned logical contrivances, they press us home, and
constrain us to exclaim, 'Never man so spake.'" Staupitz having
signified that he was entirely of this opinion, the Elector shook
him cordially by the hand, and said, "Promise me that you will
always think so."*</p>

<p>Frederick was just the prince required at the outset of the Reformation.
Too much feebleness on the part of its friends might
have allowed it to be strangled, while too much haste might have
caused the storm, which at the very first began with hollow murmuring
sound to gather against it, to burst too soon. Frederick
was moderate but strong. He had that Christian virtue which God
always requires in those who would adore his ways&mdash;he waited
upon God. He put in practice the wise counsel of Gamaliel, "If
this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but
if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it." Acts, v, 38, 39. "Matters,"
said this prince to Spengler of Nuremberg, one of the most
enlightened men of his time; "matters are come to such a point,
that there is nothing more which men can do in them; God alone
must act. To His mighty hand, therefore, we commit these great
events, which are too difficult for us." Providence made an admirable
choice in selecting such a prince to protect his work in its
infancy.</p>

<p>The discoveries made by kings had gradually extended to their
subjects. The wise began to habituate themselves to the idea that
the Bishop of Rome was only a man, and sometimes even a very
bad man. They had a suspicion that he was no holier than the
bishops, whose reputation was very equivocal. The licentiousness
of the popes roused the indignation of Christendom, and hatred of
the Roman name rankled in the heart of the nations.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Numerous causes concurred in facilitating the deliverance of the
different countries of the West. Let us glance at these countries.</p>

<p>The empire was a confederation of different states, with an
emperor at their head, each state having supreme authority within
its own territory. The Imperial Diet, composed of all the princes
or sovereign states, legislated for the whole Germanic body. It
belonged to the emperor to ratify the laws, decrees, or resolutions
of the assembly, and to see them applied and carried into execution,
while the seven most powerful princes under the title of Electors,
had the disposal of the imperial crown.</p>

<p>The north of Germany, inhabited chiefly by the ancient Saxon
race, had acquired the greatest degree of freedom. The emperor,
incessantly attacked by the Turks in his hereditary possessions,
was obliged to court those princes and bold nations whose aid
was then necessary to him. Free towns in the north, west, and
south of the empire, had, by their trade, their manufactures, and
exertions of every description, risen to a high degree of prosperity,
and thereby of independence, but the powerful house of Austria,
then invested with the imperial crown, held the greater part of the
southern states of Germany under its control, and closely watched
their movements. It was preparing to extend its dominion over
the whole empire, and even beyond it, when the Reformation interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a mighty barrier to its encroachments, and saved the independence
of Europe.</p>

<p>As Judea, when Christianity arose, was in the centre of the
ancient world, so Germany was in the centre of Christendom, looking
at once toward the Netherlands, England, France, Switzerland,
Italy, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, Denmark, and all the North.
It was in the heart of Europe that the principle of life was to be
developed, and the beatings of this heart were to circulate through
all the arteries of the body the noble blood which was to give
animation to all its members.</p>

<p>The particular constitution which the empire had received conformably
to the dispensation of Providence, favoured the propagation
of new ideas. Had Germany been a monarchy properly so
called, like France or England, the arbitrary will of the monarch
might have been able long to arrest the progress of the gospel.
But it was a confederation. Truth attacked in one state might be
received with favour in another.</p>

<p>The internal peace which Maximilian had just secured for the
empire was not less favourable to the Reformation. For a long
time the numerous members of the Germanic body had taken
pleasure in tearing each other. Nought had been seen but trouble
and discord, war incessantly renewed, neighbour against neighbour,
town against town, and noble against noble. Maximilian
had given a solid basis to public order, by erecting the Imperial
Chamber, with power to decide in all questions between different
states. The inhabitants of Germany, after all their troubles and
disquietudes, saw the commencement of a new era of security and
repose. Nevertheless, when Luther appeared, Germany still presented
to the observing eye that kind of motion which agitates the
sea after long protracted storms. The calm was uncertain. More
than one example of this will be seen as we proceed. By giving
an entirely new impulse to the Germanic nations, the Reformation
put an end for ever to all the former causes of agitation. Destroying
the system of barbarism, which had till then been paramount,
it put Europe in possession of a new system.</p>

<p>Christianity had, at the same time, exercised a peculiar influence
on Germany. The middle classes had made rapid improvement.
Throughout the different quarters of the empire, and more especially
in the free towns, were numerous institutions well fitted to
improve the great mass of the population. In these arts flourished.
The burghers, devoting themselves in security to the calm toils
and sweet relations of social life, became more and more accessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to knowledge, and in this way were continually acquiring new influence
and authority. The foundation of the Reformation in
Germany was not to be laid by magistrates, who must often shape
their conduct according to political exigencies, nor by nobles fired
with the love of military glory, nor by a greedy and ambitious
clergy, working religion for profit, as if it were their exclusive
property. The task was reserved for the citizens, the commonalty,
the great body of the people.</p>

<p>The national character of the Germans was specially fitted to
adapt itself to a religious Reformation. No spurious civilisation
had enervated it. The precious seed, which the fear of God deposits
in the bosom of a people, had not been thrown to the winds.
Ancient manners yet existed, displaying themselves in that integrity
and fidelity, that love of labour, that perseverance, that serious
temper, which is still to be seen, and gives presage of greater success
to the gospel, than the jeering levity, or boorish temper of
some other European nations.</p>

<p>The people of Germany were indebted to Rome for the great
instrument of modern civilisation, viz., faith, polish, learning, laws,
all save their courage and their arms, had come from the sacerdotal
city, and, in consequence, Germany had ever after been in close
alliance with the Papacy. The one was a kind of spiritual conquest
by the other, and we all know to what purposes Rome has
invariably applied her conquests. Nations which were in possession
of faith and civilisation before a Roman pontiff existed, always
maintained in regard to him, a greater measure of independence.
Still the more thorough the subjugation of the German, the more
powerful will the reaction be when the period of awakening shall
arrive. When Germany does open her eyes, she will indignantly
break loose from the chains which have so long held her captive.
The bondage she has had to endure will make her more
sensible of her need of deliverance; and freedom, and bold
champions of the truth, will come forth from this house of hard
labour and bondage, in which all her people have, for ages, been
confined.</p>

<p>There was, at that time, in Germany, what the politicians of
our days call a "see-saw system." When the emperor was of
a resolute character, his power increased; when, on the contrary,
he was of a feeble character, the influence and power of the princes
and electors were enlarged. Never had these felt themselves
stronger in regard to their chief than in the time of Maximilian,
at the period of the Reformation; and as he took part against it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
it is easy to understand how favourable the circumstance of his
comparative weakness must have been to the propagation of the
gospel.</p>

<p>Moreover, Germany was tired of what the Romans derisively
styled "the patience of the Germans." They had indeed, shown
much patience from the days of Louis of Bavaria, when the emperors
laid down their arms, and the tiara was placed, without
opposition, above the crown of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>The contest, however, had done little more than change its
place, by descending several steps. The same struggles which
the emperors and popes had exhibited to the world were soon renewed
on a smaller scale, in all the towns of Germany, between
the bishops and the magistrates. The burghers took up the
sword which the emperors had allowed to drop from their hands.
As early as 1329 the burghers of Frankfort on the Oder had intrepidly
withstood all their ecclesiastical superiors. Excommunicated
for having continued faithful to the Margrave Louis, they
had been left for twenty-eight years without mass, baptism, marriage,
or Christian burial; and, when the monks and priests made
their re-entry, they laughed at it as a comedy or farce,&mdash;sad
symptoms, doubtless, but symptoms of which the clergy were the
cause. At the period of the Reformation this opposition between
the magistrates and ecclesiastics had increased. The privileges
of the former, and the temporal pretensions of the latter, were
constantly causing jostling and collision between the two bodies.</p>

<p>But burgomasters, councillors, and secretaries of towns, were
not the only persons among whom Rome and the clergy found
opponents. Wrath was at the same time fermenting among the
people, and broke out as early as 1502, when the peasantry, indignant
at the grinding yoke of their ecclesiastical sovereigns,
entered into a combination which goes under the name of the
Shoe-Alliance.</p>

<p>Thus everywhere, both in the upper and lower regions of society,
a grumbling sound was heard,&mdash;a precursor of the thunder which
was soon to burst. Germany seemed ripe for the work which
the sixteenth century had received as its task. Providence, which
moves leisurely, had every thing prepared, and the very passions
which God condemns were to be overruled by his mighty hand for
the accomplishment of his designs.</p>

<p>Let us see how other nations were situated.</p>

<p>Thirteen small republics, placed with their confederates in the
centre of Europe among mountains, forming, as it were, its citadel,
contained a brave and simple people. Who would have gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
those obscure valleys in quest of persons who, with the sons of
Germany, might be the deliverers of the Church? Who would
have thought that petty unknown towns, just emerging from barbarism,
hid behind inaccessible mountains, at the extremity of
nameless lakes, would, in point of Christianity, take precedence
of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome? Nevertheless,
it so pleased Him who wills that one spot of earth be watered
with dew, and that another spot on which the rain has not
descended shall remain parched, (Amos.)</p>

<p>There were other circumstances besides which might have been
expected to throw numerous obstacles in the way of the Reformation
among the Helvetic Republics. If, in a monarchy, the impediments
of power were to be dreaded, the thing to be feared in
a democracy was the precipitation of the people.</p>

<p>But Switzerland had also had its preparations. It was a wild
but noble tree, which had been preserved in the bosom of the valleys,
in order that a valuable fruit might one day be engrafted on
it. Providence had diffused among this new people principles of
independence and freedom, destined to display their full power
whenever the signal for contest with Rome should be given. The
pope had given the Swiss the title of Protectors of the Liberty of
the Church; but they seem to have taken the honourable appellation
in a very different sense from the pontiff. If their soldiers
guarded the pope in the vicinity of the ancient Capitol, their
citizens, in the bosom of the Alps, carefully guarded their religious
liberties against the assaults of the pope and the clergy. Ecclesiastics
were forbidden to apply to a foreign jurisdiction. The
"Letter of the Priests" (Pfaffenbrief, 1370) was an energetic
protestation of Swiss liberty against the abuses and power of the
clergy. Amongst these states, Zurich was distinguished for its
courageous opposition to the pretensions of Rome. Geneva, at the
other extremity of Switzerland, was at war with its bishop. These
two towns particularly signalised themselves in the great struggle
which we have undertaken to describe.</p>

<p>But if the Swiss towns, accessible to every kind of improvement,
were among the first to fall in with the movement of reform,
it was otherwise with the inhabitants of the mountains.
The light had not yet travelled so far. These cantons, the founders
of Swiss freedom, proud of the part which they had performed
in the great struggle for independence, were not readily disposed
to imitate their younger brethren of the plains. Why change the
faith with which they had chased Austria, and which had by its
altars consecrated all the scenes of their triumph? Their priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
were the only enlightened guides to whom they could have recourse.
Their worship and their festivals gave a turn to the monotony
of their tranquil life, and pleasantly broke the silence of
their peaceful retreats. They remained impervious to religious
innovation.</p>

<p>On crossing the Alps, we find ourselves in that Italy which
was in the eyes of the majority the Holy Land of Christendom.
Whence should Europe have expected the good of the Church if
not from Italy, if not from Rome? Might not the power which by
turns raised so many different characters to the pontifical chair,
one day place in it a pontiff who would become an instrument of
blessing to the heritage of the Lord? Or if pontiffs were to be
despaired of, were there not bishops and councils, who might reform
the Church? Nothing good comes out of Nazareth; but out of
Jerusalem, out of Rome!... Such might be the thoughts of
men, but God thought otherwise. He said, "Let him who is
filthy, be filthy still," (Rev., xxii,) and abandoned Italy to her
iniquities. This land of ancient glory was alternately a prey to
intestine wars and foreign invasion. The wiles of politics, the
violence of faction, the turmoil of war, seemed to have sole sway,
and to banish far away both the gospel and its peace.</p>

<p>Besides, Italy, broken, dismembered, and without unity, seemed
little fitted to receive a common impulse. Each frontier was a new
barrier where truth was arrested.</p>

<p>And if the truth was to come from the North, how could the
Italians, with a taste so refined, and a society in their eyes so exquisite,
condescend to receive any thing at the hands of barbarous
Germans? Were men who admired the cadence of a sonnet more
than the majesty and simplicity of the Scriptures, a propitious soil
for the seed of the divine word? But be this as it may, in regard
to Italy, Rome was still to continue Rome. Not only did the
temporal power of the popes dispose the different Italian factions
to purchase their alliance and favour at any price, but in addition
to this, the universal ascendancy of Rome presented various attractions
to the avarice and vanity of the ultramontane states. The
moment that the question of emancipating the rest of the world
from Rome should be raised, Italy would again become Italy;
domestic quarrels would not prevail to the advantage of a foreign
system. Attacks on the head of the Peninsular family would at
once revive affections and common interests which had long been
in abeyance.</p>

<p>The Reformation had therefore little chance in that quarter.
And yet there did exist, beyond the mountains, individuals who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
had been prepared to receive the gospel light, and Italy was not
entirely disinherited.</p>

<p>Spain had what Italy had not&mdash;a grave, noble, and religiously-disposed
people. At all times has it numbered men of piety and
learning among its clergy, while it was distant enough from Rome
to be able easily to shake off the yoke. There are few nations where
one might have more reasonably hoped for a revival of that primitive
Christianity which Spain perhaps received from St. Paul
himself. And yet Spain did not raise her head among the nations.
She was destined to fulfil the declaration of Divine wisdom, "The
first shall be last." Various circumstances led to this sad result.</p>

<p>Spain, in consequence of its isolated position, and its distance
from Germany, must have felt only slight shocks of the great
earthquake which so violently heaved the empire. It was moreover,
engrossed with treasures very different from those which the
word of God then offered to the nations. The new world eclipsed
the eternal world. A land altogether new, and apparently
silver and gold, inflamed all imaginations. An ardent desire for
riches left no room in a Spanish heart for nobler thoughts. A
powerful clergy, with scaffolds and treasures at its disposal, ruled
the Peninsula. The Spaniard willingly yielded a servile obedience
to his priests, who, disburdening him of the prior claims of
spiritual occupation, left him free to follow his passions, and to
run the way of riches, discoveries, and new continents. Victorious
over the Moors, Spain had, at the expence of her noblest
blood, pulled down the crescent from the walls of Grenada, and
many other cities, and, in its place, planted the cross of Jesus
Christ. This great zeal for Christianity, which seemed to give
bright hopes, turned against the truth. Why should Catholic
Spain, which had vanquished infidelity, not oppose heresy? How
should those who had chased Mahomet from their lovely country
allow Luther to penetrate into it? Their kings did even more.
They fitted out fleets against the Reformation, and in their eagerness
to vanquish it, went to seek it in Holland and England. But
these attacks aggrandised the nations against which they were directed,
and their power soon crushed Spain. In this way, these
Catholic regions lost, through the Reformation, even that temporal
prosperity which was the primary cause of their rejection of the
spiritual liberty of the gospel. Nevertheless, it was a brave and
generous people that dwelt beyond the Pyrenees. Several of their
noble sons with the same ardour, but with more light than those
who had shed their blood in Moorish dungeons, came to lay their
life, as an offering, on the faggot piles of the Inquisition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>It was nearly the same with Portugal as with Spain. Emmanuel
the Happy gave it an age of gold, which must have unfitted
it for the self-denial which the gospel demands. The Portuguese,
rushing into the recently discovered routes to the East
Indies and Brazil, turned their backs on Europe and the Reformation.</p>

<p>Few nations might have been thought more disposed than France
to receive the gospel. Almost all the intellectual and spiritual
life of the middle ages centred in her. One would have said that
the paths were already beaten for a great manifestation of the
truth. Men who were the most opposed to each other, and who
had the greatest influence on the French people, felt that they had
some affinity with the Reformation. St. Bernard had given an
example of that heart-felt faith, that inward piety, which is the
finest feature of the Reformation, while Abelard had introduced
into the study of theology that reasoning principle, which, incapable
of establishing truth, is powerful in destroying falsehood.
Numerous heretics, so called, had rekindled the flames of the
word of God in the French provinces. The University of Paris
had withstood the Church to the face, and not feared to combat
her. At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Clemangis and
the Gersons had spoken out boldly. The pragmatic sanction had
been a great act of independence, and promised to prove the palladium
of the Gallican liberties. The French nobility, so numerous
and so jealous of their precedence, and who, at this period, had
just seen their privileges gradually suppressed to the extension of
the influence of the crown, must have felt favourably disposed towards
a religious revolution, the effect of which might be to restore
a portion of the independence which they had lost. The
people, lively, intelligent and open to generous emotions, were
accessible to the truth in a degree as great, if not greater, than any
other people. The Reformation might have promised to be, in
this nation, the birth that was to crown the long travail of many
ages. But the Church of France, which seemed for so many generations
to have been rushing in the same direction, turned suddenly
round at the moment of the Reformation, and took quite a
contrary direction. Such was the will of Him who guides nations
and their rulers. The prince who then sat in the chariot and held
the reins, and who, as a lover of letters, might have been thought
likely to be the first to second reform, threw his people into another
course. The symptoms of several centuries proved fallacious, and
the impulse given to France struck and spent itself on the ambition
and fanaticism of its kings. The Valois took the place which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
she ought to have occupied. Perhaps, if she had received the
gospel, she would have become too powerful. God was pleased
to take the feeblest nations, nations that as yet were not, to make
them the depositaries of his truth. France, after having been
almost reformed, ultimately found herself again become Roman
Catholic. The sword of princes thrown into the scale, made it incline
towards Rome. Alas! another sword, that of the reformed
themselves, completed the ruin of the Reformation. Hands habituated
to the sword, unlearned to pray. It is by the blood of
its confessors, and not by that of its enemies, that the gospel
triumphs.</p>

<p>At this time the Netherlands was one of the most flourishing
countries in Europe. It contained an industrious population, enlightened
by the numerous relations which it maintained with the
different quarters of the world, full of courage, and zealous to excess
for its independence, its privileges, and its freedom. Placed on
the threshold of Germany, it must have been one of the first to
hear the sound of the Reformation. Two parties, quite distinct
from each other, occupied these provinces. The more Southern
one was surfeited with wealth, and submitted. How could all
those manufactures, carried to the highest perfection&mdash;how could
that boundless traffic by land and sea&mdash;how could Bruges, the
great entrepot of the trade of the North&mdash;how could Antwerp,
that queen of commercial cities, accommodate themselves to a
long and sanguinary struggle for points of faith? On the contrary,
the northern provinces defended by their sands, the sea, and their
inland waters, and still more, by the simplicity of their manners,
and their determination to lose all sooner than the gospel, not only
saved their franchises, their privileges, and their faith, but also
conquered their independence, and a glorious national character.</p>

<p>England scarcely seemed to promise what she has since performed.
Repulsed from the Continent, where she had so long been
obstinately bent on conquering France, she began to throw her
eye towards the ocean, as the domain which was to be the true
scene of her conquests, and which was reserved for her inheritance.
Twice converted to Christianity, once under the ancient
Britons, and the second time under the Anglo-Saxons, she very
devoutly paid to Rome the annual tribute of St. Peter. But she
was reserved for high destinies. Mistress of the ocean, and present
at once in all the different quarters of the globe, she, with
the nations that were to spring from her, was one day to be the
hand of God in shedding the seeds of life over the remotest islands
and the largest continents. Already several circumstances gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a presentiment of her destiny. Bright lights had shone in the
British Isles, and some glimmerings still remained. A multitude
of foreigners, artists, merchants, and mechanics, arriving from the
Netherlands, Germany, and other countries, filled their cities and
their sea-ports. The new religious ideas must have been conveyed
easily and rapidly. In fine, the reigning monarch was an eccentric
prince, who, possessed of some knowledge and great courage, was
every moment changing his projects and ideas, and turning from
side to side, according to the direction in which his violent passions
blew. It was possible that one of the inconsistencies of Henry
VIII might prove favourable to the Reformation.</p>

<p>Scotland was at this time agitated by factions. A king five
years old, a queen regent, ambitious nobles, and an influential
clergy, kept this bold nation in constant turmoil. It was, nevertheless,
one day to hold a first place among those that received
the Reformation.</p>

<p>The three kingdoms of the North, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
were united under a common sceptre. These rude and warlike
nations seemed to have little in common with the doctrine of
love and peace. And yet, by their very energy, they were, perhaps,
more disposed than the people of the South to receive the
evangelical doctrine in its power. But, the descendants of warriors
and pirates, they brought, it would seem, too warlike a character
to the Protestant cause; at a later period, their sword defended
it with heroism.</p>

<p>Russia, retired at the extremity of Europe, had few relations
with other states, and belonged, moreover, to the Greek communion.
The Reformation effected in the Western exerted little or no
influence on the Eastern Church.</p>

<p>Poland seemed well prepared for a reform. The vicinity of the
Christians of Bohemia and Moravia had disposed it to receive,
while the vicinity of Germany must have rapidly communicated,
the evangelical impulse. So early as 1500, the nobility of Poland
Proper had demanded the cup for the laity, appealing to the
usage of the primitive Church. The liberty enjoyed by its towns,
and the independence of its nobles, made it a safe asylum for Christians
persecuted in their own country, and the truth which they
brought thither was received with joy by a great number of its
inhabitants. In our days, however, it is one of the countries
which has the smallest number of confessors.</p>

<p>The flame of reformation, which had long gleamed in Bohemia,
had been almost extinguished in blood. Nevertheless, precious remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which had escaped the carnage, still survived to see the
day of which John Huss had a presentiment.</p>

<p>Hungary had been torn by intestine wars under the government
of princes without character and without experience, and
who had at last yoked the fate of their people to Austria, by giving
this powerful House a place among the heirs of the crown.</p>

<p>Such was the state of Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, which was destined to produce so mighty a transformation
in Christian society.</p>

<p>Having pointed out the state of nations and princes, we now
proceed to the preparation for Reform, as existing in Theology
and in the Church.</p>

<p>The singular system of Theology which had been established
in the Church must have powerfully contributed to open the eyes
of the rising generation. Made for an age of darkness, as if such
an age had been to exist for ever, it seemed destined to become
obsolete and defective in all its parts as soon as the age should
have improved. Such was the actual result. The popes had
from time to time made various additions to Christian doctrine.
They had changed or taken away whatever did not accord with
their hierarchy, while any thing not contrary to their system was
allowed to remain till further orders. This system contained true
doctrines, such as redemption, and the influence of the Holy Spirit;
and these an able theologian, if any such then existed, might have
employed to combat and overthrow all the rest. The pure gold,
mingled with the worthless lead in the treasury of the Vatican,
made it easy to detect the imposition. It is true, that when any
bold opponent called attention to it, the fanner of Rome immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
threw out the pure grain. But these very proceedings only
increased the confusion.</p>

<p>This confusion was unbounded, and the pretended unity was
only a heap of disunion. At Rome there were doctrines of the
Court, and doctrines of the Church. The faith of the metropolis
differed from the faith of the provinces; while in the provinces,
again, the variation was endless. There was a faith for princes,
a faith for the people, and a faith for religious orders. Opinions
were classed as belonging to such a convent, such a district, such
a doctor, such a monk.</p>

<p>Truth, in order to pass peacefully through the time when Rome
would have crushed her with an iron sceptre, had done, like the
insect which with its threads forms the chrysalis in which it
shuts itself up during the cold season. And strange enough, the
instruments which divine truth had employed for the purpose
were the so much decried schoolmen. These industrious artisans
of thought had employed themselves in unravelling all theological
ideas, and out of the numerous threads had made a veil under
which the ablest of their contemporaries must have found it difficult
to recognise the truth in its original purity. It seems a sad
thing, that an insect full of life, and sometimes glowing with the most
brilliant colours, should enclose itself, apparently without life, in
its dark cocoon; and yet it is the shroud that saves it. It was the
same with truth. Had the selfish and sinister policy of Rome, in
the days of her ascendancy, met the truth in naked simplicity, she
would have destroyed, or at least tried to destroy it, but disguised
as it was, by the theologians of the time, under subtleties and endless
distinctions, the popes either saw it not, or thought that,
in such a state, it could not do them harm. They accordingly
patronised both the workmen and their work. But spring might
come, and then forgotten truth might lift her head, and throw
aside her shroud. In her seeming tomb, having acquired new
strength, she might now again prove victorious over Rome and
all its errors. This spring arrived. At the moment when the
absurd trappings of the schoolmen were falling off under the attack
of skilful hands, and amid the jeers of the new generation, truth
made her escape, and came forth all young and beautiful.</p>

<p>But not merely did the writings of the schoolmen bear powerful
testimony in favour of truth. Christianity had everywhere
imparted a portion of her own life to the life of the people. The
Church of Christ was like a building which had fallen into ruin;
in digging among its foundations, a portion of the solid rock on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stitutions, which dated from the pure times of the Church, were
still existing, and could not fail to suggest to many minds evangelical
ideas utterly at variance with the prevailing superstitions.
Moreover, the inspired writers and ancient doctors of the Church,
whose writings were extant in many libraries, occasionally sent
forth a solitary voice; and may we not hope that this voice was
listened to in silence by more than one attentive ear? Let us not
doubt, (and how sweet the thought!) Christians had many brothers
and many sisters in those monasteries, in which we are too
ready to see nothing but hypocrisy and dissoluteness.</p>

<p>The Church had fallen in consequence of having lost the grand
doctrine of Justification by faith in the Saviour; and hence, before
she could rise, it was necessary that this doctrine should be restored.
As soon as it was re-established in Christendom, all the
errors and observances which had been introduced, all that multitude
of saints, pious works, penances, masses, indulgences, etc.,
behoved to disappear. As soon as the one Mediator and his one
sacrifice were recognised, all other mediators and other sacrifices
were done away. "This article of justification," says one whom
we may regard as divinely illumined on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> "is that
which creates the Church, nourishes, builds up, preserves, and
defends her. No man can teach well in the Church, or successively
resist an adversary, unless he hold fast by this truth. This,"
adds the writer from whom we quote, "is the heel which bruises
the Serpent's head."</p>

<p>God, who was preparing his work, raised up during the revolution
of ages a long series of witnesses to the truth. But the
truth to which those noble men bore testimony, they knew not
with sufficient clearness, or at least were unable to expound with
sufficient distinctness. Incapable of accomplishing the work, they
were just what they should have been in order to prepare it. We
must add, however, that if they were not ready for the work, the
work was not ready for them. The measure was not yet filled
up. Ages had not accomplished their destined course, and the
need of a true remedy was not generally felt.</p>

<p>No sooner had Rome usurped power than a powerful opposition
was formed against her,&mdash;an opposition which extended across
the middle ages.</p>

<p>In the ninth century, Archbishop Claude of Turin, and in the
twelfth century, Peter of Bruges, his disciple Henry, and Arnold of
Brescia, in France and in Italy endeavour to establish the worship
of God in spirit and in truth. Generally, however, in searching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for this worship, they confine it too much to the exclusion of images
and external observances.</p>

<p>The Mystics, who have existed in almost all ages, seeking in
silence for holiness of heart, purity of life, and tranquil communion
with God, cast looks of sadness and dismay on the desolation
of the Church. Carefully abstaining from the scholastic
brawls and useless discussions under which true piety had been
buried, they endeavoured to withdraw men from the vain mechanism
of external worship, and from the mire and glare of ceremonies,
that they might lead them to the internal repose enjoyed by
the soul which seeks all its happiness in God. This they could not
do without coming at every point into collision with accredited
opinions, and without unveiling the sores of the Church. Still
they had no clear view of the doctrine of justification by faith.</p>

<p>The Vaudois, far superior to the Mystics in purity of doctrine,
form a long chain of witnesses to the truth. Men enjoying more
freedom than the rest of the Church, appear to have inhabited the
heights of the Alps in Piedmont from ancient times; and their
numbers were increased, and their doctrine purified, by the followers
of Valdo. From their mountain tops the Vaudois, during
a long series of ages, protest against the superstitions of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
"They contend for the living hope which they have in God through
Christ, for regeneration, and inward renewal by faith, hope, and
charity, for the merits of Jesus Christ, and the all-sufficiency of
his righteousness and grace."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Still, however, this primary truth of a sinner's justification,
this capital doctrine, which ought to have risen from the midst
of their doctrines, like Mont Blanc from the bosom of the Alps,
has not due prominence in their system. Its top is not high
enough.</p>

<p>In 1170, Peter Vaud, or Valdo, a rich merchant of Lyons, sells
all his goods and gives to the poor. He, as well as his friends,
seem to have had it in view practically to realise the perfection
of primitive Christianity. He, accordingly, begins in like manner
with the branches, and not the root. Nevertheless, his word is
powerful, because of his appeal to Scripture, and shakes the Roman
hierarchy to its very foundations.</p>

<p>In 1360, Wickliffe appears in England, and appeals from the
pope to the word of God, but the real internal sore of the Church
is, in his eyes, only one of the numerous symptoms of disease.</p>

<p>John Huss lifts his voice in Bohemia, a century before Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lifts his in Saxony. He seems to penetrate farther than his predecessors
into the essence of Christian truth. He asks Christ to give
him grace to glory only in his cross, and in the inestimable weight
of his sufferings, but his attention is directed less against the errors
of the Roman Church, than the scandalous lives of its clergy.
He was, however, if we may so speak, the John Baptist of the
Reformation. The flames of his martyrdom kindled a fire in the
Church, which threw immense light on the surrounding darkness,
and the rays of which were not to be so easily extinguished.</p>

<p>John Huss did more; prophetic words came forth from the
depth of his dungeon. He had a presentiment, that the true Reformation
of the Church was at hand. So early as the period
when chased from Prague, he had been forced to wander in the
plains of Bohemia, where his steps were followed by an immense
crowd of eager hearers, he had exclaimed, "The wicked have
begun to lay perfidious nets for the Bohemian goose;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but if even
the goose, which is only a domestic fowl, a peaceful bird, and
which never takes a lofty flight into the air, has, however, broken
their toils, other birds of loftier wing will break them with much
greater force. Instead of a feeble goose, the truth will send
eagles and falcons, with piercing eye."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The Reformers fulfilled
this prediction.</p>

<p>And after the venerable priest had been summoned before the
Council of Constance, after he had been thrown into prison, the
chapel of Bethlehem, where he had proclaimed the Gospel and
the future triumphs of Jesus Christ, occupied him more than his
defence. One night, the holy martyr thought he saw, in the
depth of his dungeon, the features of Jesus Christ, which he had
caused to be painted on the walls of his study, effaced by the
pope and the bishops. The dream distresses him, but next day
he sees several painters employed in restoring the pictures in
greater number and splendour. Their task finished, the painters,
surrounded by a great multitude, exclaim, "Now, let popes and
bishops come, they never shall efface them more." John Huss
adds, "Many people in Bethlehem rejoiced, and I among them."
"Think of your defence, rather than of dreams," said his faithful
Friend, Chevalier de Chlum, to whom he had communicated the
dream. "I am not a dreamer," replied Huss; "but this I hold for
certain&mdash;the image of Christ will never be effaced. They wished
to destroy it, but it will be painted anew in men's hearts by far
abler preachers than I. The nation which loves Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
will rejoice; and I, awaking among the dead, and, so to speak,
rising again from the tomb, will thrill with joy."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>A century elapsed, and the torch of the Gospel, rekindled by
the Reformers, did, in fact, illumine several nations which rejoiced
in its light.</p>

<p>But in those ages, a word of life is heard not only among those
whom Rome regards as its adversaries; Catholicity itself&mdash;let us
say it for our comfort&mdash;contains in its bosom numerous witnesses
to the truth. The primitive edifice has been consumed; but a
noble fire is slumbering under its ashes, and we see it from time
to time throwing out brilliant sparks.</p>

<p>It is an error to suppose that, up to the Reformation, Christianity
existed only under the Roman Catholic form, and that, at
that period only, a part of that church assumed the form of Protestantism.</p>

<p>Among the doctors who preceded the sixteenth century, a
great number, doubtless, inclined to the system which the Council
of Trent proclaimed in 1562, but several also inclined to the
doctrines professed at Augsburgh in 1530 by the Protestants; the
majority, perhaps, vibrated between the two.</p>

<p>Anselm of Canterbury lays down the doctrines of the incarnation
and expiation as of the essence of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> And in a treatise
in which he teaches how to die, he says to the dying person,
"Look only to the merits of Jesus Christ." St. Bernard with
powerful voice proclaims the mystery of redemption. "If my fault
comes from another," says he, "why should not my righteousness
also be derived? Certainly, it is far better for me to have it
given me, than to have it innate."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Several schoolmen, and after
them chancellor Gerson, forcibly attack the errors and abuses
of the Church.</p>

<p>But, above all, let us think of the thousands of obscure individuals
unknown to the world, who, however, possessed the true
life of Christ.</p>

<p>A monk named Arnoldi, daily in his quiet cell utters this fervent
exclamation, "O Jesus Christ my Lord! I believe that thou
alone art my redemption and my righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Christopher of Utenheim, a pious bishop of Bâsle, causes his
name to be written on a picture painted on glass, and surrounds
it with this inscription, that he may have it always under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
eye, "The cross of Christ is my hope; I seek grace, and not
works."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Friar Martin, a poor Carthusian, wrote a touching confession,
in which he says, "O most loving God! I know there is no other
way in which I can be saved and satisfy thy justice, than by the
merit, the spotless passion, and death of thy well-beloved Son.
Kind Jesus! All my salvation is in thy hands. Thou canst not
turn the arms of thy love away from me, for they created, shaped,
and ransomed me. In great mercy, and in an ineffable manner,
thou hast engraved my name with an iron pen on thy side, thy
hands, and thy feet," etc. Then the good Carthusian places his
confession in a wooden box, and deposits the box in a hole which
he had made in the wall of his cell.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The piety of Friar Martin would never have been known had
not the box been found, 21st December, 1776, in taking down
an old tenement which had formed part of the Carthusian Convent
at Bâsle.</p>

<p>But this touching faith these holy men had only for themselves,
and knew not how to communicate to others. Living in retreat,
they might more or less say, as in the writing which Friar Martin
put into his box, "Et si hæc prædicta confiteri non possim
lingua, confiteor tamen corde et scripto." "And these things
aforesaid, if I cannot confess with the tongue, I, however, confess
with the heart and in writing." The word of truth was in the
sanctuary of some pious souls, but, to use a Scripture expression,
it had not "free course" in the world. Still, if the doctrine of
salvation was not always confessed aloud, there were some in the
very bosom of the Church of Rome who, at least, feared not to
declare openly against the abuses which dishonoured it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Councils of Constance and Bâsle, which
condemned Huss and his followers, been held, than the noble
series of witnesses against Rome, to which we have been pointing,
again appears with greater lustre. Men of a noble spirit, revolting
at the abominations of the Papacy, rise up like the prophets
under the Old Testament, like them sending forth a voice of thunder,
and with a similar fate. Their blood reddens the scaffold,
and their ashes are thrown to the wind.</p>

<p>Thomas Conecte, a Carmelite, appears in Flanders, and declares,
"that abominations are done at Rome, that the Church has need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of reformation, and that, in the service of God, one must not fear
the excommunications of the pope."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Flanders listens with enthusiasm,
but Rome burns him in 1432, and his contemporaries
exclaim that God has exalted him to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>André, Archbishop of Crayn, and a Cardinal, being at Rome as
the ambassador of the emperor, is amazed when he sees that the
holiness of the pope, in which he had devoutly believed, is only a
fable; and in his simplicity he addresses evangelical representations
to Sextus IV. He is answered with mockery and persecution.
Then (1482) he wishes a new Council to be assembled at
Bâsle. "The whole Church," exclaims he, "is shaken by divisions,
heresies, sins, vices, iniquities, errors, and innumerable evils, so
much so, that it is on the eve of being swallowed up by the devouring
abyss of condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This is my only reason for proposing
a General Council for the Reformation of the Catholic
faith, and the amendment of manners." The Archbishop of Bâsle
was thrown into the prison of that town, and there died. Henry
Institoris, the inquisitor, who first moved against him, used these
remarkable words, "The whole world is crying out and demanding
a council; but no human power can reform the Church by
means of a Council. The Almighty will find another method,
which is now unknown to us, though it is at the door; and, by
this method the Church will be brought back to its primitive
condition."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This remarkable prophecy, pronounced by an inquisitor,
at the very period of Luther's birth, is the finest apology for
the Reformation.</p>

<p>The Dominican, Jerome Savonarola, shortly after he had entered
the order at Bologna in 1475, devotes himself to constant prayer,
fasting, and macerations, and exclaims, "O thou who art good,
in thy goodness teach me thy righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Translated to
Florence in 1489, he preaches with effect; his voice is thrilling,
his features animated, his action beautifully attractive. "The
Church," exclaims he, "must be renewed." And he professes
the grand principle which alone can restore life to it. "God,"
says he, "forgives man his sin, and justifies him in the way of
mercy. For every justified person existing on the earth, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
has been an act of compassion in heaven; for no man is saved by
his works. None can glory in themselves; and if in the presence
of God, the question were put to all the righteous, 'Have you
been saved by your own strength?' they would all with one
voice exclaim, 'Not unto us, O Lord, but unto thy name be the
glory.' Wherefore, O God, I seek thy mercy, and I bring
thee not my own righteousness: the moment thou justifiest me by
grace, thy righteousness belongs to me; for grace is the righteousness
of God. So long, O man, as thou believest not, thou art,
because of sin, deprived of grace. O God, save me by thy righteousness,
that is, by thy Son, who alone was found righteous
among men."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Thus the great and holy doctrine of justification
by faith gladdens the heart of Savonarola. In vain do the prelates
of the Church oppose him;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> he knew that the oracles of God
are superior to the visible church, and that he must preach them
with her, without her, or in spite of her.&mdash;"Fly far from Babylon,"
exclaims he. It is Rome he thus designates. Rome
soon answers him in her own way. In 1497 the infamous Alexander
launches a brief at him, and in 1498 torture and faggot do
their work on the Reformer.</p>

<p>A Franciscan, named John Vitraire, of Tournay, whose monastic
spirit seems not of a very elevated description, nevertheless,
declaims forcibly against the corruption of the Church. "It were
better for a man," says he,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> "to cut his child's throat than put
it into a religion not reformed. If your curate, or any other
priest, keep women in his house, you ought to go and drag the
women by force, or in any other way, pell-mell, out of the house.
There are some persons who say prayers to the Virgin Mary,
in order that, at the hour of death, they may see the Virgin Mary.
Thou shalt see the devil, and not the Virgin Mary." The monk
was ordered to retract, and he did so in 1498.</p>

<p>John Laillier, a Doctor of Sorbonne, declares, in 1484, against
the tyrannical domination of the hierarchy. "All ecclesiastics,"
says he, "have received equal power from Christ. The Roman
Church is not the head of other churches. You ought to
keep the commandments of God and the Apostles; and, in regard
to the command of all the bishops and other lords of the
Church, care no more for it than you would for a straw; they
have destroyed the Church by their tricks.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The priests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Eastern Church sin not in marrying; and, believe me, neither
shall we in the Western Church if we marry. Since St. Sylvester
the Church of Rome has been, not a church of Christ, but a
church of State and money. We are no more bound to believe
the legends of the saints than the Chronicles of France."</p>

<p>John of Wessalia, a doctor of theology at Erfurt, a man of
great spirit and intellect, attacks the errors on which the hierarchy
rests, and proclaims the holy Scriptures to be the only
source of faith. "It is not religion" (that is, the monastic state)
"that saves us," says he to some monks, "but the grace of God.
God has from all eternity kept a book in which he has entered all
his elect. Whosoever is not entered there will not, through
eternity; and whosoever is, will never see his name erased. It
is solely by the grace of God that the elect are saved. He whom
God is pleased to save, by giving him grace, will be saved, though
all the priests in the world were to condemn and excommunicate
him. And he whom God sees meet to condemn, though these
should all wish to save him, will be made to feel his condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
How audacious in the successors of the apostles to order,
not what Christ has prescribed in his holy books, but what they
themselves devised, when carried away, as they now are, by a thirst
for money, or a rage for power. I despise the pope, the Church,
and the Councils, and I extol Jesus Christ." Wessalia, who had
gradually arrived at those convictions, boldly announces them
from the pulpit, and enters into communication with deputies from
the Hussites. Feeble, bent with age, and wasted by disease, the
courageous old man, with tottering step, appears before the Inquisition,
and, in 1482, dies in its dungeons.</p>

<p>About the same time, John de Goch, prior at Malines, extolled
Christian liberty as the soul of all the virtues. He charged the
received doctrine with Pelagianism, and surnamed Thomas Aquinas
the "Prince of Error." "Canonical Scripture alone," said
he, "deserves full faith, and has an irrefragable authority. The
writings of the ancient fathers are of authority only in so far as
they are conformable to canonical truth.&mdash;There is truth in the
common byword, 'What a monk dares undertake, Satan would
blush to think.'"</p>

<p>But the most remarkable of the forerunners of the Reformation
was undoubtedly John Wessel, surnamed "The Light of the
World," a man full of courage and love for the truth, who taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
theology successively at Cologne, Louvain, Paris, Heidelberg, and
Gröningen. Luther said of him, "Had I read his works sooner,
it might have been said, Luther has drawn everything from Wessel;
so much do his spirit and mine accord."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> "St. Paul and St.
James," says Wessel, "say different but not contrary things.
Both hold that the just live by faith, but a faith which works by
love. He who understanding the gospel believes, desires, hopes,
confides in the good news, and loves Him who justifies and blesses
him, gives himself entirely to Him whom he loves, and attributes
nothing to himself, knowing that in himself he has nothing.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
The sheep should distinguish between the things on which they
feed, and avoid a hurtful food, though it should be offered by the
shepherd. The people ought to follow their shepherds to the pastures,
but when they lead them to what is not pasture, they are
no more shepherds; and because they are not in their duty, the
flock is no longer bound to obey them. Nothing is more effectual
in destroying the Church than a corrupt clergy. All Christians,
even the meanest and simplest, are bound to resist those who destroy
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The commands of prelates and doctors ought
to be performed only in the manner prescribed by St. Paul, (1
Thess., v, 21;) namely, in so far as, sitting in the chair of Moses,
they speak according to Moses. We are the servants of God, and
not of the pope, according as it is said, 'Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' The Holy Spirit
has reserved to himself to foster, quicken, preserve, and enlarge the
unity of the Church, and not abandoned it to the Roman Pontiff,
who often gives himself no concern about the matter. Even sex
does not hinder a woman, if she is faithful and prudent, and has
love shed abroad in her heart, from feeling, judging, approving,
and concluding, by a judgment which God ratifies."</p>

<p>Thus, as the Reformation approaches, the voices which proclaim
the truth are multiplied. One would say the Church is bent on
demonstrating that the Reformation had an existence before
Luther. Protestantism was born into the Church, the very day
that the germ of the Papacy appeared in it, just as in the political
world conservative principles began to exist the very moment
that the despotism of the great or the disorders of the factious
showed open front. Protestantism was even sometimes stronger
than the Papacy in the ages preceding the Reformation. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
had Rome to oppose to all these witnesses for the truth at the
moment when their voice was heard through all the earth?</p>

<p>But this was not all. The Reformation existed not in the
teachers only; it existed also among the people. The doctrines of
Wickliffe, proceeding from Oxford, had spread over Christendom,
and had preserved adherents in Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, and
Prussia. In Bohemia, from the bosom of discord and war, ultimately
came forth a peaceful Christian community, which resembled
the primitive Church, and bore lively testimony to the
great principle of Evangelical opposition, viz., "That Christ himself,
not Peter and his successor, is the rock on which the Church
is built." Belonging equally to the German and Slavonian races,
these simple Christians had missionaries among the different nations
who spoke their tongues, that they might without noise gain
adherents to their opinions. At Rostoch, which had been twice
visited by them, Nicolas Kuss began in 1511 to preach publicly
against the pope.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>It is important to attend to this state of things. When wisdom
from above will with loud voice deliver her instructions, there will
everywhere be intellects and hearts to receive it. When the
sower, who has never ceased to walk over the Church, will come
forth for a new and extensive sowing, the earth will be ready to
receive the grain. When the trumpet, which the Angel of the
covenant has never ceased to blow, will cause it to sound louder
and louder, many will make ready for battle.</p>

<p>The Church already feels that the hour of battle is approaching.
If, during the last century, more than one philosopher gave intimation
of the revolution with which it was to close, can we be
astonished, that, at the end of the fifteenth century, several doctors
foresaw the impending Reformation which was to renovate
the Church?<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>André Prolés, provincial of the Augustins, who, for more than
half a century, presided over this body, and with unshaken courage
maintained the doctrines of Augustine within his order, when
assembled with his friars in the Convent of Himmelspforte, near
Wernigerode, often stopped during the reading of the word of
God, and addressing the listening monks, said to them "Brethren,
you hear the testimony of holy Scripture. It declares, that
by grace we are what we are&mdash;that by it alone we have all that
we have. Whence, then, so much darkness, and so many horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
superstitions?... Oh! brethren, Christianity has need of
a great and bold reformation, and I already see its approach."
Then the monks exclaimed, "Why don't you yourself begin this
reformation, and oppose all their errors?" "You see, my brethren,"
replied the old provincial, "that I am weighed down with
years, and feeble in body, and possess not the knowledge, talent,
and eloquence, which so important a matter requires. But God
will raise up a hero, who, by his age, his strength, his talents, his
knowledge, his genius, and eloquence, will occupy the first rank.
He will begin the reformation, he will oppose error, and God will
give him such courage that he will dare to resist the great."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> An
old monk of Himmelspforte, who had often heard these words, related
them to Flacius. In the very order of which Prolés was
provincial, the Christian hero thus announced by him was to appear.</p>

<p>In the Franciscan Convent at Isenach, in Thuringia, was a
monk named John Hilten. He was a careful student of the Prophet
Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John; he even wrote a
Commentary on these Books, and censured the most crying abuses
of monastic life. The enraged monks threw him into prison. His
advanced age, and the filthiness of his dungeon, bringing on a
dangerous illness, he asked for the friar superintendant, who had
no sooner arrived, than, without listening to the prisoner, he began
to give vent to his rage, and to rebuke him harshly for his doctrine,
which (adds the chronicle) was at variance with the monk's kitchen.
The Franciscan, forgetting his illness, and fetching a deep
sigh, exclaims, "I calmly submit to your injustice for the love of
Christ; for I have done nothing to shake the monastic state, and
have only censured its most notorious abuses. <i>But</i>," continued
he, (this is the account given by Melancthon in his <i>Apology for
the Confession of Augsburg</i>,) "<i>another will come in the year of the
Lord one thousand five hundred and sixteen; he will destroy you,
and you will not be able to resist him.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> John Hilten, who had announced
the end of the world in the year 1651, was not so much
mistaken in the year in which the future Reformer was to appear.
He was born not long after at a short distance from Hilten's dungeon,
commenced his studies in the same town where the monk
was prisoner, and publicly engaged in the Reformation only a year
later than the Franciscan had mentioned.</p>

<p>Thus princes and people, the living members of the Church,
and the theologians, laboured, each in their sphere, to prepare the
work which the sixteenth century was about to carry into effect.
But there was another auxiliary which was to lend its aid to the
Reformation,&mdash;I mean Literature.</p>

<p>The human mind was expanding&mdash;a circumstance which must
of itself have led to its emancipation. If a small seed fall close to
an old wall, as it grows into a tree it will push down the wall.</p>

<p>The Pontiff of Rome had become tutor to the nations, and his
superior intelligence had made the task easy to him. He had
long kept them in a state of minority, but resistance now broke
forth on all sides. This venerable tutelage, which had been primarily
established by the principles of eternal life, and of civilisation
which Rome had imparted to barbarous nations, could no
longer be exercised without opposition. A formidable adversary
had met her in the face, and was prepared to control her. The
natural tendency of the human mind to expand, to investigate,
and acquire knowledge, had given birth to this new power. Man
opened his eyes, and at every step questioned the proceedings of
that long respected guide under whose direction, while blindfolded,
he had moved on without saying a word. In regard to
the nations of new Europe, the age of infancy had passed away,
and that of manhood had begun. To the childlike simplicity,
which believed everything, had succeeded a spirit of curiosity, an
intellect not to be satisfied without sifting everything to the
utmost. It was asked for what end God had spoken to the world,
and whether men had a right to station themselves as mediators
between God and their brethren.</p>

<p>There was only one thing which could have saved the Church,
and this was to raise herself still higher above the people. To
keep on a level with them was not enough. But so far from this,
she was even found to be far beneath them, having begun to descend
at the same time that they began to rise. At the period when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mankind began to ascend to the regions of intellect, the priesthood
was grovelling below among earthly pursuits and worldly
interests. This phenomenon has repeatedly appeared in history.
The wings of the eaglet were full fledged, and what hand was high
enough to prevent it from taking its flight?</p>

<p>The human mind made its first start in Italy.</p>

<p>Scholasticism and romantic poetry had at no time reigned unopposed.
Italy never entirely lost the remembrance of antiquity;
and this remembrance having been strongly awakened towards
the end of the middle ages, soon gave the mind a new impulse.</p>

<p>Even in the fourteenth century, Dante and Petrarch restored the
honour of the ancient Roman poets, at the same time that the
former gave the most powerful popes a place in his hell, and the
latter boldly protested for the primitive constitution of the Church.
At the beginning of the fifteenth century, John of Ravenna
taught Latin literature with applause at Padua and Florence,
while Chrysoloras, at Florence and Pavia, interpreted the beautiful
writers of Greece.</p>

<p>While in Europe light was thus coming forth from the prisons
in which it had been confined, the East was sending new beams
to the West. The standard of the Osmanlis, planted in 1453 on
the walls of Constantinople, had put the learned to flight. They
had, in consequence, transported the literature of Greece into Italy,
where the torch of the ancients rekindled minds which had lain
smothered for so many ages. George of Trebisond, Argyropolos,
Bessarion, Lascaris, Chalcondylas, and many others, inspired
the West with their love of Greece and its noblest productions.
The patriotic feelings of the Italians were thus stimulated,
and a great number of learned men appeared in Italy. Of these,
the most illustrious were Gasparino, Aretin, Poggio, and Valla,
who strove to restore the honour of Roman antiquity, and place
it on a footing with that of Greece. In this way, a great flood of
light had appeared, and Rome could not but suffer by it.</p>

<p>The passion for antiquity, which took possession of the <i>Humanists</i>,
had a great effect in weakening the attachment to the Church
in minds of the highest order; for "no man can serve two masters."
At the same time, the studies in which the learned were
engaged put them in possession of a new class of instruments, which
were unknown to the schoolmen, and by means of which they
could test and decide upon the lessons of the Church. Finding
that beauties which charmed them in classical authors existed
in profusion in the Bible, and not in the works of theologians,
the <i>Humanists</i> were quite prepared to give the Bible precedence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
before the Doctors. By reforming taste, they prepared a reformation
in faith.</p>

<p>The Literati, it is true, loudly protested that their pursuits were
not at variance with the belief of the Church; but yet they had
assailed the schoolmen long before the Reformers began to do it,
and played off their wit on these barbarians&mdash;those "Teutons who
living, lived not."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Some even proclaimed doctrines of the gospel,
and assailed Rome in the objects of her dearest affection. Already
Dante, while adhering to many Roman dogmas, had proclaimed
the power of faith in terms similar to those which the first Reformers
employed. "It is true faith," he said, "that makes us
citizens of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Faith, according to the gospel doctrine, is the
principle of life; it is the feeble spark which, spreading always
wider and wider, at length becomes a living flame, and shines
within us like a star in heaven. Without faith, no good works, no
honesty of life, can give us aid. How great soever our sins may
be, the arms of divine grace are greater still, and wide enough to
embrace whatever turns towards God.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The soul is not lost by
the anathema of the pontiffs; and eternal love can always reach it,
so long as there remains one bloom of hope.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> From God, from
God alone, through faith our justice comes." And speaking of the
Church, Dante exclaims, "O my bark! how ill loaded thou art!
O Constantine! what mighty evil was engendered, I will not say
by thy conversion, but by that offering which the rich father then
received from thee!"</p>

<p>At a later period, Laurentius Valla, applying the study of antiquity
to the opinions of the Church, denies the authenticity of the
correspondence between Christ and King Abgarus, rejects the tradition
as to the origin of the Apostles' Creed, and saps the foundation
of the pretended inheritance which the popes held of Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Still, however, the great light which the study of antiquity threw
out in the fifteenth century, was fitted only to destroy, and not to
build up. The honour of saving the Church could not be given
either to Homer or Virgil. The revival of letters, sciences, and
arts did not found the Reformation. The Paganism of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
poets, on reappearing in Italy, rather strengthened the Paganism
of the heart. The scepticism of the school of Aristotle, and a contempt
of everything not connected with philology, took possession
of many of the Literati, and engendered an infidelity which, while
it affected submission to the Church, in reality attacked the most
important truths of religion. Peter Pomponatius, the most famous
representative of this impious tendency, taught at Bologna and
Padua, that the immortality of the soul and providence are only
philosophical problems.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> John Francis Pica, nephew of Pica de
la Mirandôla, tells of a pope who did not believe a God,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and of
another who, having confessed to one of his friends, that he did
not believe in the immortality of the soul, appeared one night after
his death to the same friend, and said to him, "Ah! the eternal
fire that consumes me, makes me but too sensible of the immortality
of that soul, which, according to the view I held, was to
die with the body." This reminds us of the celebrated words
which Leo X is alleged to have said to his Secretary Bembo, "All
ages know well enough of what advantage this fable about Christ
has been to us and ours."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>... Frivolous superstitions
were attacked, but their place was supplied by infidelity, with
its disdainful sneering laugh. To laugh at things, however sacred,
was fashionable, and a proof of wit; and if any value was
set on religion, it was merely as a mean of governing the people.
"I have a fear," exclaimed Erasmus in 1516, "and it is, that,
with the study of ancient literature, ancient Paganism will re-appear."</p>

<p>It is true that then, as after the sarcasms of the age of Augustus,
and as in our own times, after those of the last century, a new
Platonic philosophy sprung up and attacked that irrational incredulity,
seeking, like the philosophy of the present day, to inspire
some respect for Christianity, and restore the religious sentiment
to the heart. The Medici at Florence favoured these efforts of the
Platonics. But no philosophical religion will regenerate the Church
and the world. Proud, disdaining the preaching of the cross, and
pretending to see nothing in Christian doctrines but figures and
symbols, which the majority of men cannot comprehend, it may bewilder
itself in a mystical enthusiasm, but will always prove powerless,
either to reform or to save.</p>

<p>What then must have happened, had not true Christianity
re-appeared in the world, and had not faith filled the hearts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
men anew with its power and its holiness? The Reformation
saved religion, and with it society, and, therefore, if the Church of
Rome had had the glory of God and the good of the people at
heart, it would have welcomed the Reformation with delight. But
what were such things as these to Leo X?</p>

<p>However, a torch could not be lighted in Italy without sending
its beams beyond the Alps. The affairs of the Church established
a constant intercourse between the Italian Peninsula and the
other parts of Christendom, and the <i>barbarians</i> being thus soon
made to feel the superiority and pride of the Italians, began to
blush for the imperfection of their language and their style. Some
young noblemen, a Dalberg, a Langen, a Spiegelberg, inflamed with
an eager desire of knowledge, passed over into Italy, and on their
return to Germany, brought back learning, grammar, and the
classics, now so eagerly sought after, and communicated them to
their friends.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Shortly after, Rodolph Agricola, a man of distinguished
genius, appeared, and was held in as high veneration for
his learning and genius, as if he had lived in the age of Augustus
or Pericles. The ardour of his mind, and the fatigues of the school,
wore him out in a few years; but not till noble disciples had been
trained, through intimate intercourse with him, to carry their master's
fire all over Germany. Often, when assembled around him,
they had together deplored the darkness of the Church, and asked
why Paul so often repeats that men are justified by faith and not
by works.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Around the feet of these new teachers soon gathered rustic youths,
who lived by alms and studied without books, and who, divided
into sections of priests of Bacchus, arquebusiers, and many more
besides, moved in disorderly bands from town to town, and school
to school. No matter; these strange bands were the commencement
of a literary public. The masterpieces of antiquity began
gradually to issue from the presses of Germany, supplanting the
schoolmen; and the art of printing, discovered at Mayence in 1440,
multiplied the energetic voices which remonstrated against the corruption
of the Church, and those voices, not less energetic, which
invited the human mind into new paths.</p>

<p>The study of ancient literature had, in Germany, very different
effects from those which it had in Italy and France. Her
study was combined with faith. In the new literary culture,
Germany turned her attention to the advantage which religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
might derive from it. What had produced in some a kind of intellectual
refinement, of a captious and sterile nature, penetrated
the whole life of others, warmed their hearts, and prepared them
for a better light. The first restorers of letters in France were
characterised by levity, and often even by immorality of conduct.
In Germany, their successors, animated by a spirit of gravity,
zealously devoted themselves to the investigation of truth. Italy
offering her incense to profane literature and science, saw an infidel
opposition arise. Germany, occupied with a profound theology,
and turned inwardly upon herself, saw the rise of an opposition
based on faith. The one sapped the foundations of the
Church, and the other repaired them. Within the empire was
formed a remarkable union of free, learned, and noble-minded men,
among whom princes were conspicuous, who endeavoured to render
science useful to religion. Some brought to their studies the humble
faith of children, while others brought an enlightened and penetrating
intellect, disposed, perhaps, to exceed the bounds of legitimate
freedom and criticism; both, however, contributed to clear the
pavement of the temple from the obstructions produced by so many
superstitions.</p>

<p>The monkish theologians perceived their danger, and began to
clamour against the very studies which they had tolerated in Italy
and France, because in those countries they had gone hand in
hand with levity and dissoluteness. They entered into a conspiracy
to oppose the study of language and science, because they
had caught a glimpse of faith following in their rear. A monk
was putting some one on his guard against the heresies of Erasmus.
"In what," it was asked, "do they consist?" He confessed
that he had not read the work of which he was speaking, but
one thing he knew, viz., that Erasmus had written in too good
Latin.</p>

<p>The disciples of literature, and the scholastic theologians, soon
came to an open rupture. The latter were in dismay when they
saw the movement which was taking place in the domain of intellect,
and thought that immobility and darkness were the best
safeguards of the Church. Their object in contending against the
revival of letters was to save Rome, but they helped to ruin it.
Here Rome had much at stake. Forgetting herself for an instant
under the pontificate of Leo X, she abandoned her old friends,
and clasped her young adversaries in her arms. The papacy and
letters formed an intimacy which seemed destined to break up
the ancient alliance between monasticism and the hierarchy. At
the first glance the popes perceived not that what they had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for a whip was a sword capable of inflicting a mortal wound.
In the same way, during the last century, princes were seen receiving
at their court political and philosophic systems, which, if
carried into full effect, would have overturned their thrones. The
alliance was not of long duration. Literature advanced without
troubling itself about the injury which it might do to the power of
its patron. The monks and schoolmen were aware that to abandon
the pope was just to abandon themselves; and the pope, notwithstanding
of the passing patronage which he gave to the fine
arts, was not the less active when he saw the danger, in adopting
measures, how much opposed soever they might be to the spirit of
the time.</p>

<p>The universities defended themselves as they best could against
the invasion of new light. Cologne expelled Rhagius; Leipsic,
Celtes; Rostoch, Herman von dem Busch. Still the new doctors,
and with them the ancient classics, gradually and often even by
the aid of princes, made good their footing in these public schools.
Societies of grammarians and poets were soon established in spite
of the schoolmen, and every thing, even to the name of the Literati,
behoved to be converted into Latin and Greek; for how could
the friends of Sophocles and Virgil have such names as Krachenberger
or Schwarzerd? At the same time, a spirit of independence
breathed in all the universities. Students were no longer seen in
schoolboy fashion, with their books under their arms, walking
sagely and demurely with downcast eye behind their masters. The
petulance of a Martial and an Ovid had passed into the new disciples
of the Muses. It was transport to them to hear the sarcasms
which fell in torrents on the dialectical theologians, and the heads
of the literary movement were sometimes accused of favouring, and
even of exciting, the disorderly proceedings of the students.</p>

<p>Thus a new world, emerging out of antiquity, was formed in the
very heart of the world of the middle ages. The two parties
could not avoid coming to blows, and the struggle was at hand.
It began with the greatest champion of literature, with an old man
on the eve of finishing his peaceful career.</p>

<p>To secure the triumph of truth, the first thing necessary was to
bring forth the weapons by which she was to conquer, from the
arsenals where they had lain buried for ages. These weapons
were the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It was
necessary to revive in Christendom a love and study of sacred
literature, both Greek and Hebrew. John Reuchlin was the individual
whom divine Providence selected for this purpose.</p>

<p>A very fine boy's voice was remarked in the choir of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Pforzheim, and attracted the attention of the Margrave of
Baden. It was that of John Reuchlin, a young boy of agreeable
manners and a lively disposition, son of an honest burgher of the
place. The Margrave soon took him entirely under his protection,
and in 1473 made choice of him to accompany his son Frederick
to the University of Paris.</p>

<p>The son of the bailiff of Pforzheim arrived with the prince, his
heart exuberant with joy at being admitted to this school, the
most celebrated of all the West. Here he found the Spartan Hermonymos
and John Wessel, surnamed "The Light of the World,"
and had an opportunity of engaging under skilful masters in the
study of Greek and Hebrew, which had not then a single professor
in Germany, and of which he was one day to be the restorer in the
country of the Reformation. The poor young German made copies
of the poems of Homer, and the speeches of Isocrates, for wealthy
students, and in this way gained the means of continuing his
studies and buying books.</p>

<p>But what he hears from the mouth of Wessel is of a different
nature, and makes a deep impression on his mind. "The popes
may be mistaken. All human satisfactions are blasphemy against
Christ, who has perfectly reconciled and justified the human race.
To God alone belongs the power of giving full absolution. There
is no necessity for confessing our sins to a priest. There is no
purgatory, at least if it be not God himself, who is a devouring
fire, and purges away every defilement." Reuchlin, when scarcely
twenty, teaches Philosophy, Greek, and Latin, at Bâsle, and a
German (a thing then regarded as a wonder) is heard speaking
Greek.</p>

<p>The partizans of Rome begin to feel uneasy on seeing noble
spirits at work among these ancient treasures. "The Romans,"
says Reuchlin, "are making mouths and raising an outcry, pretending
that all these literary labours are hostile to Roman piety,
inasmuch as the Greeks are schismatics. Oh! what toils and
sufferings must be endured to bring Germany back to wisdom and
knowledge!"</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Eberhard of Wurtemberg invited Reuchlin
to Tubingen, that he might be the ornament of this rising university,
and in 1483 took him with him into Italy. At Florence his
companions and friends were Chalcondylas, Aurispa, and John
Pica de Mirandola. At Rome, when Eberhard received a solemn
audience of the pope, surrounded by his cardinals, Reuchlin delivered
an address in such pure and elegant Latin, that the assembly,
who expected nothing of the kind from a barbarous German, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
filled with the greatest astonishment, while the pope exclaimed,
"Assuredly this man deserves to take his place beside the best
orators of France and Italy."</p>

<p>Ten years later Reuchlin was obliged to take refuge in Heidelberg,
at the court of the Elector Philip, to escape the vengeance of
Eberhard's successor. Philip, in concert with John of Dalberg,
Bishop of Worms, his friend and chancellor, exerted himself to
spread the light which was beginning to peep forth from all parts
of Germany. Dalberg had founded a library, to which all the
learned had free access, and Reuchlin, in this new sphere, made
great efforts to remove the barbarism of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Having been sent to Rome by the elector in 1498, on an important
mission, he availed himself of all the time and all the
money he could spare to make new progress in Hebrew, under
the learned Israelite, Abdias Sphorne, and purchased all the Greek
and Hebrew manuscripts which he could find, with the view of
employing them as so many torches to increase the light which
was beginning to dawn in his native country.</p>

<p>Argyropolos, a distinguished Greek, was at this time in the
metropolis explaining the ancient marvels of the literature of his
country to a numerous audience. The learned ambassador repairs
with his suite to the hall where the teacher was lecturing,
and, after bowing to him, deplores the misery of Greece, expiring
under the blows of the Ottomans. The astonished Hellenist
asks the German, "Who are you? Do you understand
Greek?" Reuchlin replies, "I am a German, and know something
of your tongue." At the request of Argyropolos he reads
and explains a passage of Thucydides, which the professor had at
the moment before him. Then Argyropolos, filled with astonishment
and grief, exclaims, "Alas! Alas! Greece, oppressed and
obliged to flee, has gone and hid herself beyond the Alps!"</p>

<p>Thus the sons of rude Germany, and those of ancient learned
Greece, met in the palaces of Rome, and the East and West shook
hands in this rendezvous of the world&mdash;the one pouring into the
lap of the other those intellectual treasures which had with difficulty
been saved from the barbarism of the Ottomans. God,
when his designs require it, employs some great catastrophe to
break down the barrier, and instantly bring together those who
seemed to be for ever parted.</p>

<p>Reuchlin, on his return to Germany, was able to go back to
Wurtemberg, and proceeded, at this time especially, to execute
those works which proved so useful to Luther and the Reformation.
This individual, who, as Count Palatine, held an eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
station in the empire, and who as a philosopher, contributed to
humble Aristotle and exalt Plato&mdash;made a Latin Dictionary,
which supplanted those of the Schoolmen&mdash;composed a Greek
Grammar, which greatly facilitated the study of that language&mdash;translated
and expounded the penitential Psalms&mdash;corrected
the Vulgate, and was the first in Germany (this constitutes his
highest merit and glory) who published a Hebrew Grammar
and Dictionary. By this work Reuchlin opened the long sealed
books of the Old Testament, and reared "a monument," as he
himself expresses it, "more durable than brass."</p>

<p>It was not merely by his writings, but also by his life, that
Reuchlin sought to advance the reign of truth. Tall in stature,
of commanding appearance, and affable address, he instantly
gained the confidence of all with whom he had any intercourse.
His thirst for knowledge was equalled only by his zeal in communicating
it. He spared neither money nor labour to introduce
the editions of the classics into Germany as they issued from the
presses of Italy; and in this way the son of a bailiff did more to
enlighten his countrymen than rich municipalities or powerful
princes. His influence over youth was great; and, in this respect,
who can calculate how much the Reformation owes to
him? We will give only one example. His cousin, a young man
named Schwarzerd, son of an artisan, who had acquired celebrity
as an armourer, came to lodge with his sister, Elizabeth, in order
to study under his direction. Reuchlin, delighted at the genius and
application of his young pupil, adopted him. Advice, presents of
books, examples, nothing, in short, he spared to make his relative
useful to the Church and to his country. He rejoiced to
see his work prospering under his eye; and, thinking the name
Schwarzerd too barbarous, translated it into Greek, and named
the young student Melancthon. It was Luther's illustrious friend.</p>

<p>But grammatical studies did not satisfy Reuchlin. Like his
masters, the Jewish doctors, he began to study the hidden meaning
of the Word; "God," said he, "is a Spirit, the Word is a
breath,&mdash;man breathes, God is the Word. The names which he
has given himself are an echo of eternity."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Like the Cabalists,
he hoped to "pass from symbol to symbol, from form to form,
till he arrived at the last and purest of all forms&mdash;that which
regulates the power of the Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>While Reuchlin was bewildering himself in these quiet and abstruse
researches, the enmity of the Schoolmen forced him suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and much against his will, into a fierce war, which was
one of the preludes of the Reformation.</p>

<p>There was at Cologne a baptized Rabbin, named Pfefferkorn,
who was intimately connected with the inquisitor Hochstraten.
This man and the Dominicans solicited and procured from the
emperor, Maximilian, (it may have been with good intentions,)
an order, in virtue of which the Jews were to bring all their
Hebrew books (the Bible excepted) to the town-house of the
place where they resided. There the books were to be burned.
The motive alleged was, that they were full of blasphemies against
Jesus Christ. It must be confessed that they were, at least, full
of absurdities, and that the Jews themselves would not have lost
much by the intended execution.</p>

<p>The emperor desired Reuchlin to give his opinion of the books.
The learned doctor expressly singled out all the books which were
written against Christianity, leaving them to their destined fate,
but he tried to save the others. "The best method of converting
the Israelites," added he, "would be to establish two Hebrew
professors in each University, who might teach theologians to
read the Bible in Hebrew, and thus refute the Jewish doctors."
The Jews, in consequence of this advice, obtained restitution of
their books.</p>

<p>The proselytes and the inquisitors, like hungry ravens which
see their prey escape, sent forth cries of fury. Picking out different
passages from the writings of Reuchlin, and perverting
their meaning, they denounced the author as a heretic, accused
him of a secret inclination to Judaism, and threatened him with
the fetters of the Inquisition. Reuchlin was at first taken by surprise;
but these men always becoming more and more arrogant,
and prescribing dishonourable terms, he, in 1513, published a
"Defence against his Detractors of Cologne," in which he painted
the whole party in vivid colours.</p>

<p>The Dominicans vowed vengeance, and hoped, by an act of
authority, to re-establish their tottering power. Hochstraten, at
Mayence, drew up a charge against Reuchlin, and the learned
works of this learned man were condemned to the flames. The
Innovators, the masters and disciples of the new school, feeling
that they were all attacked in the person of Reuchlin, rose as one
man. Times were changed,&mdash;Germany and literature were very
different from Spain and the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The great literary movement had created a public opinion.
Even the dignified clergy were somewhat influenced by it.
Reuchlin appeals to Leo X, and that pope, who had no great liking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for ignorant monks and fanatics, remits the whole affair to the
Bishop of Spires, who declares Reuchlin innocent, and condemns
the monks in the expences of process. The Dominicans, those
props of the papacy, filled with rage, recur to the infallible decision
of Rome, and Leo, not knowing how to act between the two
hostile powers, issues a mandate superseding the process.</p>

<p>The union of letters with faith forms one of the characteristic
features of the Reformation, and distinguishes it, both from the
introduction of Christianity, and the religious revival of the present
day. The Christians, who were contemporary with the
Apostles, had the refinement of their age against them, and, with
some few exceptions, it is the same now; but the majority of
literary men were with the Reformers. Even public opinion was
favourable to them. The work thereby gained in extent, but
perhaps it lost in depth.</p>

<p>Luther, sensible of all that Reuchlin had done, wrote to him
shortly after his victory over the Dominicans, "The Lord has
acted through you, in order that the light of Holy Scripture may
again begin to shine in this Germany, where, for many ages, alas!
it was not only smothered, but almost extinguished."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>But a man had now appeared, who regarded it as the great business
of his life to attack the scholasticism of the universities and
convents, and was the great writer of the opposition at the commencement
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Reuchlin was not twelve years old when this first genius of the
age was born. A man of great vivacity and talent, by name Gerard,
a native of Gouda, in the Netherlands, loved a physician's
daughter, named Marguerite. The principles of Christianity did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not regulate his life, or at least passion silenced them. His parents,
and nine brothers, would have constrained him to embrace
the monastic state. He fled, leaving the object of his affection
about to become a mother, and repaired to Rome. Frail Marguerite
gave birth to a son. Gerard heard nothing of it, and some
time after having received intimation from his parents, that the object
of his affection was no more, he, in a paroxysm of grief, turned
priest, and consecrated himself for ever to the service of God.
On his return to Holland, she was still alive! Marguerite would
not marry another, and Gerard, remaining faithful to his sacerdotal
vows, their affection became concentrated on their little son.
His mother had tended him with the greatest care, and his father,
after his return, sent him to school, though he was only four
years of age. He was not thirteen, when his teacher, Sinthemius,
of Deventer, clasping him rapturously in his arms, exclaimed, "This
child will reach the highest pinnacles of science." It was Erasmus
of Rotterdam.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>About this time his mother died, and his father, broken-hearted,
was not long in following her to the grave.</p>

<p>Young Erasmus, left alone in the world, showed the greatest
aversion to become a monk, a state of life which his guardians
were for compelling him to adopt, but to which, from the circumstances
of his birth, he may be said to have been always opposed.
Ultimately he was prevailed upon to enter a convent of canons
regular, but he had no sooner done it than he felt, as it were,
borne down by the weight of his vows. Recovering a little liberty,
he is soon seen, first at the Court of the Archbishop of Cambray,
and afterwards at the University of Paris, where he prosecuted his
studies in extreme poverty, but with the most indefatigable diligence.
As soon as he could procure any money, he employed the
first part of it in the purchase of Greek books, and the remainder
in the purchase of clothes. Often did the poor Dutchman make
fruitless application to his guardians, and to this probably it was
owing, that, in after life, one of his greatest pleasures was to give
assistance to poor students. Engaged without intermission in the
pursuit of truth and knowledge, he gave a reluctant attendance on
scholastic disputes, and revolted from the study of theology, afraid
that he might discover some errors in it, and be, in consequence,
denounced as a heretic.</p>

<p>It was at this time Erasmus began to feel his strength. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
study of the ancients, he acquired a perspicuity and an elegance
of style, which placed him far above the most distinguished Literati
of Paris. His employment as a teacher procured him powerful
friends, while the works which he published attracted general
admiration and applause. He well knew how to please the public,
and shaking off the last remnants of the school and the cloister,
devoted himself entirely to literature, displaying in all his
writings those ingenious observations, and that correct, lively, and
enlightened spirit, which at once amuse and instruct.</p>

<p>The laborious habits which he acquired at this period he retained
through life. Even in his journeys, which were usually
made on horseback, he was never idle. He composed while he
was rambling across the fields, and, on arriving at his inn, committed
his thoughts to writing. It was in this way, while travelling
from Italy to England, he composed his Praise of Folly.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus, early in life, acquired a high reputation among the
learned, but the enraged monks owed him a grudge, and vowed
vengeance. He was much courted by princes, and was inexhaustible
in finding excuses to evade their invitations, liking
better to gain his livelihood in correcting books with the printer
Frobenius, than to live surrounded by luxury and honour, at the
magnificent courts of Charles V, Henry VIII, and Francis I, or
to encircle his head with the Cardinal's hat which was offered
him.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>He taught in Oxford from 1509 to 1516, and then left it for
Bâsle, where he fixed his residence in 1521.</p>

<p>What was his influence on the Reformation?</p>

<p>It has been overrated by some and underrated by others. Erasmus
never was, and never could have been, a Reformer, but
he paved the way for others. Not only did he diffuse among his
contemporaries a love of science, and a spirit of research and
examination, which led others much farther than he went himself,
but he was also able, through the protection of distinguished prelates
and mighty princes, to expose the vices of the Church, and
lash them with the most cutting satire.</p>

<p>Erasmus, in fact, attacked monks and abuses in two ways.
First, there was his popular attack. That little fair-haired man,
whose peering blue eyes keenly observed whatever came before
him, and on whose lips a somewhat sarcastic smile was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
playing, though timid and embarrassed in his step, and apparently
so feeble that a breath of air might have thrown him down, was
constantly pouring out elegant and biting sarcasms against the
theology and superstition of his age. His natural character and
the events of his life had made this habitual to him. Even in
writings where nothing of the kind was to have been expected,
his sarcastic humour is ever breaking out, and, as with needle
points, impaling those schoolmen and ignorant monks against
whom he had declared war. There are many features of resemblance
between Erasmus and Voltaire. Previous authors had
given a popular turn to that element of folly which mingles with
all the thoughts and all the actions of human life. Erasmus
took up the idea, and personifying Folly, introduces her under
the name of Moria, daughter of Plutus, born in the Fortunate
Islands, nursed on intoxication and impertinence, and swaying
the sceptre of a mighty empire. Giving a description of it, she
paints, in succession, all the states of the world which belong to
her, dwelling, especially, on church folks, who refuse to own
her kindness, although she loads them with her favours. She
directs her jibes and jests against the labyrinth of dialectics, in
which the theologians wander bewildered, and the grotesque syllogisms
by which they pretend to support the Church. She also
unveils the disorders, the ignorance, the impurity, and absurd
conduct of the monks.</p>

<p>"They are all mine," says she, "those people who have no
greater delight than to relate miracles, or hear monstrous lies,
and who employ them to dissipate the ennui of others, and, at the
same time, to fill their own purses, (I allude, particularly, to priests
and preachers.) Near them are those who have adopted the
foolish, yet pleasing persuasion, that if they cast a look at a bit
of wood or a picture representing Polyphemus or Christopher,
they will, at least, outlive that day."&mdash;"Alas! what follies," continues
Moria, "follies at which even I myself can scarcely help
blushing! Do we not see each country laying claim to its particular
<i>saint</i>? Each misery has its saint and its candle. This
one relieves you in toothache, that one gives assistance at childbirth,
a third restores your stolen goods, a fourth saves you in
shipwreck, and a fifth keeps watch over your flocks. Some of
these are all-powerful in many things at once. This is particularly
the case with the Virgin, the mother of God, to whom the
vulgar attribute almost more than to her Son.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
all these follies, if some odious sage arise, and, giving a counternote,
exclaim, (as in truth he may,) 'You will not perish miserably
if you live as Christians.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> You will redeem your sins, if
to the money which you give you add hatred of the sins themselves,
tears, vigils, prayers, fastings, and a thorough change in
your mode of life. Yon saint will befriend you if you imitate his
life.'&mdash;If some sage, I say, charitably duns such words into their
ears, Oh! of what felicity does he not deprive their souls, and into
what trouble, what despondency, does he not plunge them! The
mind of man is so constituted that imposture has a much stronger
hold upon it than truth.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> If there is any saint more fabulous than
another, for instance, a St. George, a St. Christopher, or a St. Barbara,
you will see them adored with much greater devotion than
St. Peter, St. Paul, or Christ himself."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Folly, however, does not stop here; she applies her lash to the
bishops themselves, "who run more after gold than after souls,
and think they have done enough when they make a theatrical
display of themselves, as Holy Fathers, to whom adoration is due,
and when they bless or anathematise." The daughter of "the
Fortunate Isles" has the hardihood even to attack the Court of
Rome, and the pope himself, who, spending his time in diversion,
leaves Peter and Paul to perform his duty. "Are there,"
says she, "more formidable enemies of the Church than those
impious pontiffs, who, by their silence, allow Jesus Christ to be
destroyed, who bind him by their mercenary laws, falsify him by
their forced interpretations, and strangle him by their pestilential
life?"<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Holbein appended to the Praise of Folly, most grotesque engravings,
among which the pope figures with his triple crown.
Never, perhaps, was a work so well adapted to the wants of a
particular period. It is impossible to describe the impression which
it produced throughout Christendom. Twenty-seven editions were
published in the lifetime of Erasmus; it was translated into all
languages, and served more than any other to confirm the age in
its antisacerdotal tendency.</p>

<p>But to this attack by popular sarcasm, Erasmus added the
attack of science and erudition. The study of Greek and Latin
literature had opened up a new prospect to the modern genius
which began to be awakened in Europe. Erasmus entered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
all his heart into the idea of the Italians, that the school of the
ancients was that in which the sciences ought to be studied, that,
abandoning the inadequate and absurd books which had hitherto
been used, it was necessary to go to Strabo for geography, to
Hippocrates for medicine, to Plato for philosophy, to Ovid for
mythology, and to Pliny for natural history. But he took a farther
step, the step of a giant, destined to lead to the discovery of
a new world, of more importance to humanity than that which
Columbus had just added to the old world. Following out his
principle, Erasmus insisted that men should no longer study theology
in Scotus and Thomas Aquinas, but go and learn it from the
Fathers of the Church, and, above all, from the New Testament.
He showed that it was not even necessary to keep close to the
Vulgate, which swarmed with faults, and he rendered an immense
service to truth, by publishing his critical edition of the Greek
text of the New Testament, a text as little known in the West
as if it never had existed. This edition appeared at Bâsle in 1516,
the year before the Reformation. Erasmus thus did for the New
Testament what Reuchlin had done for the Old. Theologians were
thenceforth able to read the word of God in the original tongues,
and at a later period to recognise the purity of doctrine taught by
the Reformers.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Erasmus on publishing his New Testament, "to
bring to its level that frigid, wordy, disputatious thing, termed
Theology. Would to God the Christian world may derive advantage
from the work, proportioned to the pain and toil which it
has cost." The wish was accomplished. It was in vain for the
monks to exclaim, "He is trying to correct the Holy Spirit."
The new Testament of Erasmus sent forth a living light. His
paraphrases on the Epistles and Gospels of St. Matthew and St.
John; his editions of Cyprian and Jerome; his translations of
Origen, Athanasius, and Chrysostom; his "True Theology;"<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
his "Preacher;"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> his Commentaries on several of the Psalms,
contributed greatly to spread a taste for the word of God and
pure theology. The effect of his labours even went farther than
his intentions. Reuchlin and Erasmus restored the Bible to the
learned; Luther restored it to the people. We have not yet described
all that Erasmus did. When he restored the Bible, he
called attention to its contents. "The highest aim of the revival
of philosophical studies," said he, "should be to give a knowledge
of the pure and simple Christianity of the Bible." An admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sentiment! Would to God the organs of philosophy, in our day,
were as well acquainted with their calling! "I am firmly resolved,"
continued he, "to die studying the Scriptures; it is my
joy and my peace."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> "The sum of all Christian philosophy," he
elsewhere says, "is reduced to this: To place all our hope in God,
who through grace without our merits, gives us everything by
Jesus Christ: To know that we are ransomed by the death of his
Son: To die to worldly lusts, and walk conformably to his doctrine
and his example, not only doing no injury to any, but, on
the contrary, doing good to all: To bear trials patiently, in the
hope of future recompence: in fine, to claim no credit to ourselves
because of our virtues, but give thanks to God for all our
faculties, and all our works. These are the feelings which ought
to pervade the whole man, until they have become a second nature."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Then raising his voice against the great mass of ecclesiastical
injunctions, regarding dress, fasts, feast-days, vows, marriage, and
confessions, by which the people were oppressed, and the priest
was enriched, Erasmus exclaims, "In churches, the interpretation
of the gospel is scarcely thought of.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The better part of sermons
must meet the wishes of the commissaries of indulgences.
The holy doctrine of Christ must be suppressed, or interpreted
contrary to its meaning, and for their profit. Cure is now hopeless,
unless Christ himself turn the hearts of kings and pontiffs,
and awaken them to enquire after true piety."</p>

<p>The works of Erasmus rapidly succeeded each other. He laboured
incessantly, and his writings were read just as they came
from his pen. That spirit, that native life, that rich, refined,
sparkling and bold intellect, which, without restraint, poured out
its treasures before his contemporaries, carried away and entranced
vast numbers of readers, who eagerly devoured the works
of the philosopher of Rotterdam. In this way he soon became
the most influential man in Christendom, and saw pensions and
crowns raining down upon him from all quarters.</p>

<p>When we contemplate the great revolution, which, at a later
period, renewed the Church, it is impossible not to own that
Erasmus was used by many as a kind of bridge, over which they
passed. Many who would have taken alarm at evangelical truths,
if presented in all their force and purity, yielded to the charm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his writings, and ultimately figured among the most zealous promoters
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>But the very circumstance of his being good in preparing, prevented
him from being good at performing. "Erasmus knows
very well how to expose error," says Luther, "but he knows not
how to teach the truth." The gospel was not the fire which
warmed and sustained his life, the centre around which his activity
radiated. He was, first of all, a learned, and, in the second
place only, a Christian man. He was too much under the influence
of vanity to have a decided influence on his age. He
anxiously calculated the effect which every step he took might
have on his reputation, and there was nothing he liked so much
to talk of as himself and his fame. "The pope," wrote he to an
intimate friend with puerile vanity, at the period when he became
the declared opponent of Luther, "the pope has sent me a letter
full of kindness and expressions of respect. His secretary solemnly
vows that the like was never heard of, and that it was written
word for word at the pope's own dictation."</p>

<p>Erasmus and Luther are the representatives of two great ideas
on the subject of reform, and of two great parties of their own age,
and of all ages. The one is composed of men, whose leading characteristic
is a prudential timidity; the other of men of courage
and resolution. These two parties were, at this period, personified
in these two distinguished heads. The men of prudence
thought that the cultivation of theological science might lead gradually,
and without disruption, to the reformation of the Church.
The men of action thought that the diffusion of more correct ideas
among the learned would not put a stop to the superstitions of the
people, and that the correction of particular abuses was of little
avail, unless the whole life of the Church were renewed.</p>

<p>"A disadvantageous peace," said Erasmus, "is far better than
the justest war."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> He thought (and how many Erasmuses have
been and still are in the world?) that a Reformation which shook
the Church might run a risk of overturning it; and he was therefore
terrified when, on looking forward, he saw the passions of
men excited, saw evil everywhere mingling itself with any little
good that could be accomplished, existing institutions destroyed
in the absence of others to supply their place, and the vessel of
the Church leaking in every part, and at length engulfed amid the
storm. "Those who bring the sea into new lagoons," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
"are often deceived in the result; the formidable element, once
introduced, does not take the direction which they wished to give
it, but rushes where it pleases, and causes great devastation.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> "Be
this as it may," continued he, "let disturbances be by all means
avoided. Better put up with wicked princes than by innovations
enthrone evil."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>But the courageous among his contemporaries were prepared
with their answer. History had clearly enough demonstrated,
that a frank exposition of the truth, and a mortal struggle with
falsehood, could alone secure the victory. Had temporising and
politic artifices been resorted to, the wiles of the papal court would
have extinguished the light in its first glimmerings. Had not all
sorts of mild methods been tried for ages? Had not Council been
held after Council, with the view of reforming the Church? Yet
all had been useless. Why pretend to repeat an experiment that
had so often failed?</p>

<p>No doubt a fundamental reform might be effected without disruption.
But when did anything great and good make its appearance
among men without causing agitation? This fear of seeing
evil mingle with good, if legitimate, would arrest the noblest and
holiest enterprises. We must not fear the evil which may be
heaved up in the course of great agitation, but be strong in combating
and destroying it.</p>

<p>Besides, is there not an entire difference between the commotion
which human passions produces and that which emanates from
the Spirit of God? The one shakes society, the other consolidates
it. How erroneous to imagine, like Erasmus, that in the
state in which Christianity then was, with that mixture of opposite
elements, truth and falsehood, life and death, violent shocks
might still be prevented! As well might you try to shut the
crater of Vesuvius, when the angry elements are actually at war
in its bosom! The middle ages had seen more than one violent
commotion in an atmosphere less loaded with storms than at the
period of the Reformation. The thing wanted at such a time is
not to arrest and suppress, but to direct and guide.</p>

<p>If the Reformation had not burst forth, who can tell the fearful
ruin by which its place might have been supplied? Society, a
prey to a thousand elements of destruction, and destitute of regenerating
and conservative elements, would have been dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
convulsed. Assuredly it would not have been a reform to the taste
of Erasmus, or such an one as many moderate but timid men in
our day dream of, that would then have overtaken society. The
people, devoid of that light and piety which the Reformation
carried down into the humblest ranks, giving themselves up to
the violence of their passions, and to a restless spirit of revolt,
would have burst forth like a wild beast broken loose from its
chain, after having been goaded to madness.</p>

<p>The Reformation was nothing but an interposition of the Spirit
of God among men, a setting of the world in order by the hand of
God. No doubt, it might stir up the fermenting elements which
lie hidden in the human heart; but God was there to overrule
them. Evangelical doctrine, heavenly truth, penetrating the masses
of the population, destroyed what deserved to perish, but, at the
same time, gave new strength to all that deserved to remain.
The Reformation exerted itself in building up, and it is mere prejudice
to allege that it destroyed. "The ploughshare, too," it has
been truly said, in speaking of the Reformation, "might think it
hurts the earth, because it cuts it asunder, whereas it only makes
it productive."</p>

<p>The great principle of Erasmus was, "Give light, and the darkness
will disappear of itself." The principle is good, and Luther
acted on it. But when the enemies of the light strive to extinguish
it, or to force the flambeau out of the hand which carries it
is it necessary, from a love of peace, to let them do so? ought
not the wicked to be resisted?</p>

<p>Erasmus was deficient in courage. Now, courage is indispensable,
whether it be to effect a Reformation, or to storm a town.
There was much timidity in his character. From a boy the very
name of death made him tremble. He was excessively anxious
about his health, and would grudge no sacrifice in order to escape
from a place where some contagious malady prevailed. His love of
the comforts of life was greater even than his vanity, and hence his
rejection, on more than one occasion, of the most brilliant offers.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he made no pretensions to the character of a Reformer.
"If the corruptions of the Court of Rome demand some
great and prompt remedy," said he, "it is no affair of mine, or of
those like me."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> He had not the strong faith which animated
Luther. While the latter was always prepared to yield up his
life for the truth, Erasmus candidly declared, "Others may aspire
to martyrdom; as for me, I deem not myself worthy of the honour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Were some tumult to arise, I fear I would play the part of
Peter."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus, by his writings and his sayings, had done more than
any other man to prepare the Reformation; but, when he saw the
tempest, which he himself had raised, actually come, he trembled.
He would have given anything to bring back the calm of other
days, even though accompanied with its dense fogs. It was no
longer time. The embankment had burst, and it was impossible
to arrest the flood which was destined at once to purify and fertilise
the world. Erasmus was powerful as an instrument of God,
but when he ceased to be so, he was nothing.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Erasmus knew not for which party to declare. He
was not pleased with any, and he had his fears of all. "It is
dangerous to speak," said he, "and it is dangerous to be silent."
In all great religious movements we meet with those irresolute
characters, which, though respectable in some points of view, do
injury to the truth, and, in wishing not to displease any, displease
all.</p>

<p>What would become of the truth did not God raise up bolder
champions to defend it? The following is the advice which Erasmus
gave to Viglius Zuichem, (afterwards President of the Supreme
Court at Brussels,) as to the manner in which he ought to
conduct himself towards the sectaries&mdash;(this was the name by
which he had already begun to designate the Reformers)&mdash;"My
friendship for you makes me desirous that you should keep far
aloof from the contagion of the sects, and not furnish them with
any pretext for saying, 'Zuichem is ours.' If you approve their
doctrine, at least disguise it, and, above all, do not enter into discussion
with them. A lawyer should finesse with these people as
a dying man once did with the devil. The devil asked him, 'What
believest thou?' The dying man, afraid that if he made a confession
of his faith, he might be surprised into some heresy, replied,
'What the Church believes.' The devil rejoined, 'What
does the Church believe?' The man again replied, 'What I believe.'
The devil, once more, 'And what dost thou believe?'&mdash;'What
the Church believes.'"<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Duke George of Saxony, a mortal
enemy of Luther, receiving an equivocal answer from Erasmus to
a question which he had put to him, said, "My dear Erasmus,
wash the fur for me, and do not merely wet it." Secundus Curio,
in one of his works, describes two heavens&mdash;the Papistical and the
Christian heaven. He does not find Erasmus in either, but discovers
him moving constantly between them in endless circles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Such was Erasmus. He wanted that internal liberty which
makes a man truly free. How different he would have been if he
had abandoned himself, and sacrificed all for truth! But after trying
to effect some reforms with the approbation of the Church, and
for Rome deserting the Reformation when he saw the two to be
incompatible, he lost himself with all parties. On the one hand,
his palinodes could not suppress the rage of the fanatical partisans
of the Papacy. They felt the mischief which he had done them,
and they did not forgive it. Impetuous monks poured out reproaches
on him from the pulpit,&mdash;calling him a second Lucian,&mdash;a
fox, which had laid waste the vineyard of the Lord. A doctor
of Constance had the portrait of Erasmus hung up in his study,
that he might have it in his power at any moment to spit in his
face. On the other hand, Erasmus, by deserting the standard
of the gospel, deprived himself of the affection and esteem of the
noblest men of the period in which he lived, and must, doubtless,
have forfeited those heavenly consolations which God sheds in the
hearts of those who conduct themselves as good soldiers of Jesus
Christ. At least we have some indication of this in his bitter
tears&mdash;his painful vigils, and troubled sleep&mdash;his disrelish for his
food&mdash;his disgust with the study of the muses, once his only solace&mdash;his
wrinkled brow&mdash;his pallid cheek&mdash;his sad and sunken eye&mdash;his
hatred of a life to which he applies the epithet of cruel&mdash;and
those longings for death which he unbosoms to his friends.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Poor
Erasmus!</p>

<p>The enemies of Erasmus went, we think, somewhat beyond the
truth when they exclaimed, on Luther's appearance, "Erasmus
laid the egg, and Luther has hatched it."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The same symptoms of regeneration, which we have seen among
princes, bishops, and the learned, existed among the men of the
world, among nobles, knights, and warriors. The German nobility
performed an important part in the Reformation. Several of
the most illustrious sons of Germany entered into close alliance
with the Literati, and inflamed with an ardent, sometimes even an
excessive zeal, laboured to deliver their countrymen from the yoke
of Rome.</p>

<p>Various causes must have contributed to procure friends for the
Reformation among the ranks of the nobility. Some, by their
attendance at the universities, had been warmed with the same
flame that animated the learned. Others, whose education had
trained them to generous feelings, had their minds predisposed in
favour of the beautiful doctrines of the gospel. To several, the
Reformation seemed to present something of a chivalrous character,
which fascinated them, and bore them along in its train. Lastly,
it must be acknowledged, that not a few had a grudge at the
clergy, who had powerfully contributed in the reign of Maximilian,
to deprive the nobles of their ancient independence, and bring
them under subjection to their sovereigns. They, in their enthusiasm,
considered the Reformation as the prelude of a great political
renovation. They thought they saw the empire emerging from
this crisis with new splendour, and hailed the better state, brilliant
with the purest glory, which was on the eve of being established
in the world by chivalrous swords, not less than by the word of
God.</p>

<p>Ulrich de Hütten,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> who, on account of his philippics against the
Papacy, has been surnamed the Demosthenes of Germany, forms,
as it were, the link which united the chevaliers and men of letters.
He distinguished himself by his writings, as much as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his sword. Descended from an ancient family in Franconia, he was
sent at eleven years of age, to the Convent of Foulda, with the
view of his becoming a monk. But Ulrich, who had no inclination
for this state, ran off from the convent when he was sixteen, and
repaired to the University of Cologne, where he devoted himself to
the study of languages. Afterwards leading an unsettled life, he
was in the ranks as a common soldier at the siege of Padua, in 1513,
saw Rome in all its disorder, and there sharpened the arrows
which he afterwards shot at her.</p>

<p>On his return to Germany, Hütten wrote a pamphlet against
Rome, entitled "The Roman Trinity," in which he unveils all the
disorders of that court, and shows the necessity of pulling down
her tyranny by main force. A traveller named Vadiscus, who figures
prominently in the piece, says, "There are three things which are
usually brought back from Rome,&mdash;a sore conscience, a disordered
stomach, and an empty purse. There are three things which Rome
does not believe,&mdash;the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of
the dead, and hell. There are three things in which Rome carries
on a trade,&mdash;the grace of Christ, ecclesiastical benefices, and women."
The publication of this work obliged Hütten to quit the
court of the Archbishop of Mayence, where he was residing when
he composed it.</p>

<p>The affair of Reuchlin with the Dominicans was the signal
which brought forward all the literati, magistrates, and nobles,
who were opposed to the monks. The defeat of the inquisitors,
who, it was said, had only saved themselves from a regular and
absolute sentence of condemnation by money and intrigue, gave
encouragement to all their adversaries. Counsellors of the empire,
and magistrates of the most considerable towns&mdash;Pirckheimer
of Nuremberg, Peutinger of Augsburg, Stuss of Cologne, distinguished
preachers, such as Capito and &OElig;colampadius, doctors of
medicine, historians, all the literati, orators, and poets, at the head
of whom, Ulrich de Hütten was conspicuous, formed the <i>army of
Reuchlinists</i>, of whom a list was even published.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The most remarkable
production of this league was the famous popular satire,
entitled, "Letters of some Obscure Men." This production was
principally written by Hütten, and one of his university friends,
Crotus Robianus, but it is difficult to say with which of the two
the idea originated, if, indeed, it was not with the learned printer,
Angst. It is even doubtful if Hütten had any hand in the first part
of the work. Several <i>Humanists</i>, who had met in the fortress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Ebernbourg, appear to have contributed to the second part. It
is a picture in bold characters, a caricature sometimes coarsely
painted, but full of truth and vigour, a striking likeness in colours
of fire. The effect was immense. Monks, who are adversaries of
Reuchlin, and the supposed authors of the letters, discourse on the
affairs of the time, and on theological subjects after their own manner,
and in their barbarous Latin. They address to their correspondent,
Ortuin Gratius, professor at Cologne, and friend of Pfefferkorn,
the silliest and most useless questions. They give the most
amusing proof of the excessive ignorance and incredulity, their
superstition, their low and vulgar spirit, their coarse gluttony in
making a god of their belly, and, at the same time, their pride,
their fanatical and persecuting zeal. They inform him of several
of their droll adventures, their escapes, their dissoluteness, and
a variety of scandals in the lives of Hochstraten, Pfefferkorn,
and other leaders of their party. The tone of these letters, sometimes
hypocritical and sometimes childish, gives them a very
comic effect, and yet the whole is so natural, that the Dominicans
and Franciscans of England received the work with high approbation,
believing that it really was composed on the principles of
their order, and in defence of it. A prior of Brabant, in his credulous
simplicity, purchased a great number of copies, and presented
them to the most distinguished among the Dominicans.
The monks, irritated more and more, applied to the pope for a
stringent bull against all who should dare to read these epistles,
but Leo X refused to grant it. They were accordingly obliged
to put up with the general laugh, and gulp down their rage. No
work gave a stronger blow to these pillars of Papism. But it was
not by jesting and satire that the gospel was to triumph. Had
this course been persisted in; had the Reformers, instead of
attacking the Reformation with the weapons of God, had recourse
to the jeering spirit of the world, the cause had been lost. Luther
loudly condemned these satires. A friend having sent him one of
them, entitled, "<i>The Tenor of the Supplication of Pasquin</i>," he
wrote in answer, "The foolish things you sent me appear to be
written by a mind which is under no control. I submitted them
to a meeting of friends, and they have all given the same opinion."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
And speaking of the same work, he writes to another of his correspondents,
"This Supplication appears to me to be by the same
hand as the <i>Letters of some Obscure Men</i>. I approve of his
wishes, but I approve not of his work, for he does not refrain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
injury and insult."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This sentence is severe, but it shows what
kind of spirit was in Luther, and how superior he was to his contemporaries.
It must be added, however, that he was not at all
times observant of these wise maxims.</p>

<p>Ulrich having been obliged to renounce the protection of the
Archbishop of Mayence, applied for that of Charles V, who had
at this time quarrelled with the pope, and accordingly repaired to
Brussels, where Charles was holding his court. But so far from
obtaining anything, he learned that the pope had required the
emperor to send him to Rome bound hand and foot. The inquisitor,
Hochstraten, Reuchlin's persecutor, was one of those
whom Rome had charged to pursue him. Ulrich, indignant that
such a demand should have been made to the emperor, quitted
Brabant. When a short way from Brussels, he met Hochstraten
on the highroad. The inquisitor, frightened out of his wits, falls
on his knees, and commends his soul to God and the saints. "No,"
said the knight, "I will not soil my sword with such blood as
yours!" and giving him several strokes with the flat of his sword,
allowed him to depart.</p>

<p>Hütten took refuge in the castle of Ebernbourg, where Francis
de Seckingen offered an asylum to all who were persecuted by the
Ultramontanists. It was here that his ardent zeal for the emancipation
of his country dictated the remarkable letters which he addressed
to Charles V, Frederick Elector of Saxony, Albert Archbishop
of Mayence, and the princes and nobles, and which entitle
him to a place among the most distinguished authors. Here too,
he composed all those works<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> which, being read and comprehended
by the people, inspired Germany with a hatred of Rome and a
love of freedom. Devoted to the cause of the Reformers, his object
was to induce the nobility to take up arms in favour of the
gospel, and fall with the sword on that Rome which Luther only
wished to destroy by the Word, and by the invincible force of
truth.</p>

<p>Still, amid all this fondness for war, we are pleased at finding
tenderness and delicacy of sentiment in Hütten. On the death of
his parents, though he was the eldest son, he gave up all the family
property to his brothers, and prayed them not to write him
or send him any money, lest, notwithstanding their innocence,
they might be brought into trouble by his enemies, and fall into
the ditch along with him.</p>

<p>If the truth cannot own Hütten for one of her children, (for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
companions are ever holiness of life and purity of heart,) she will,
at least, make honourable mention of him, as one of the most readoubtable
adversaries of error.</p>

<p>A similar testimony may be borne to François de Seckingen, his
illustrious friend and patron. This noble chevalier, whom several
of his contemporaries deemed worthy of the imperial crown, holds
first place among the warriors who were the antagonists of Rome.
While delighting in the noise of arms, he had an ardent love of
science, and a high veneration for its professors. When at the
head of an army which threatened Wurtemberg, he gave orders,
in the event of Stuttgard being taken by assault, to spare the
property and house of the celebrated scholar, John Reuchlin. He
afterwards invited him to his camp, and, embracing him, offered to
assist him in his quarrel with the monks of Cologne. For a long
time chivalry had gloried in despising literature, but this period
presents us with a different spectacle. Under the massy cuirass
of the Seckingens and Hüttens, we perceive the intellectual movement
which is beginning to be everywhere felt. The first fruits
which the Reformation gives to the world are warriors enamoured
with the arts of peace.</p>

<p>Hütten, who, on his return from Brussels, had taken refuge in
the castle of Seckingen, invited the valorous knight to study the
evangelical doctrine, and made him acquainted with the foundations
on which it rests. "And is there any one," exclaimed Seckingen
in astonishment, "who dares to overturn such an edifice?
Who could do it?"</p>

<p>Several individuals, who afterwards became celebrated as Reformers,
found an asylum in this castle; among others, Martin
Bucer, Aquila, Schwebel, and &OElig;colampadius, so that Hütten
justly styled Ebernbourg "the hotel of the just." &OElig;colampadius
had to preach daily in the castle, but the warriors there assembled
began to weary hearing so much of the meek virtues of
Christianity, and the sermons of &OElig;colampadius, though he laboured
to shorten them, seemed too long. They, indeed, repaired to
the church almost every day, but, for the most part, only to hear
the blessing and offer a short prayer. Hence &OElig;colampadius exclaimed,
"Alas! the Word is here sown on stony ground."</p>

<p>Seckingen, longing to serve the cause of truth in his own way,
declared war on the Archbishop of Treves, "in order," as he said,
"to open a door for the gospel." In vain did Luther, who had
by this time appeared, endeavour to dissuade him; he attacked
Treves with five thousand knights and a thousand common soldiers,
but the bold archbishop, aided by the Elector Palatine and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Landgrave of Hesse, forced him to retreat. The following spring,
the allied princes attacked him in his castle of Landstein. After
a bloody assault, Seckingen, having been mortally wounded, was
forced to surrender. The three princes, accordingly, make their
way into the fortress, and, after searching through it, at last find
the indomitable knight on his death-bed, in a subterraneous vault.</p>

<p>He stretches out his hand to the Elector Palatine, without seeming
to pay any attention to the other princes, who overwhelm him
with questions and reproaches: "Leave me at rest," said he to
them; "I am now preparing to answer a mightier than you!..."
When Luther heard of his death he exclaimed, "The Lord is just,
yet wonderful! It is not with the sword that he means to propagate
the gospel!"</p>

<p>Such was the sad end of a warrior, who, as emperor or elector,
might, perhaps, have raised Germany to high renown, but
who, confined within a limited circle, wasted the great powers
with which he was endowed. It was not in the tumultuous spirit
of these warriors that Divine truth, which had come down from
heaven, was to take up her abode. Theirs were not the weapons
by which she was to conquer; God, in annihilating the mad projects
of Seckingen, gave a new illustration of the saying of St. Paul,
"The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
God."</p>

<p>Another chevalier, Harmut of Cronberg, a friend of Hütten and
Seckingen, appears to have had more wisdom and more knowledge
of the truth. He wrote with great moderation to Leo X, beseeching
him to give up his temporal power to its rightful possessor,
viz., the emperor. Addressing his dependants like a father, he
endeavoured to make them comprehend the doctrines of the gospel,
and exhorted them to faith, obedience, and confidence in Jesus
Christ, "who," added he, "is the sovereign Lord of all." He resigned
a pension of two hundred ducats into the hands of the emperor,
"because he was unwilling," as he expressed it, "to continue
in the service of one who lent his ear to the enemies of the
truth." I have somewhere met with a beautiful saying of his,
which seems to place him far above Hütten and Seckingen. "The
Holy Spirit, our heavenly Teacher, is able, when he pleases, to
teach us more of the faith of Christ in one hour than we could
learn in ten years at the University of Paris."</p>

<p>Those who look for the friends of reformation only on the steps
of thrones,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> or in cathedrals and academies, and maintain that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
such friends exist among the people, are under a serious mistake.
God, while preparing the heart of the wise and powerful, was also
preparing, in retirement, many simple and humble-minded men,
who were one day to become obedient to the Word. The history
of the period gives evidence of the fermentation which was
then going on among the humbler classes. The popular literature,
previous to the Reformation, had a tendency directly opposed to
the spirit which was prevalent in the Church. In the "Eulenspiegel,"
a celebrated popular poetical collection of the period, the
laugh is incessantly kept up at priests, beasts, and gluttons, who
keep full-stocked cellars, fine horses, and well-lined pantries. In
the "Renard Reinecke," the households of priests, with their little
children, play an important part. Another popular writer thunders
with all his might against those ministers of Christ who ride
splendid horses, but won't fight the infidels; and John Rosenblut,
in one of his carnival games, brings the Grand Turk upon the stage,
to preach a seasonable sermon to all the states of Christendom.</p>

<p>It was unquestionably in the bowels of the people that the Reformation,
which was soon to break out, was fermenting. Not
only from this class were youths seen coming forth, who were
afterwards to occupy the first stations in the Church, but even
individuals, who continued all their lives to labour in the humblest
professions, contributed powerfully to the great awakening of
Christendom. It may be proper to give some traits in the life of
one of them.</p>

<p>On the 5th November 1494, a tailor of Nuremberg, by name
Hans Sachs, had a son born to him. The son, named Hans (John)
like his father, after having received some schooling, was apprenticed
to a shoemaker. Young Hans availed himself of the liberty
of thought, which this humble profession afforded, to penetrate
into the higher world, in which his soul delighted. Songs, after
they ceased in the castles of chivalry, seem to have sought, and
to have found, an asylum among the burghers of the joyous cities
of Germany. A singing-school was held in the Church of Nuremberg.
The performances which took place there, and in which
young Hans was accustomed to join, opened his heart to religious
impressions, and helped to awaken a taste for poetry and music.
The genius of the youth could not long brook confinement within
the walls of his workshop. He wished to see with his own eyes
that world of which he had read so much, and been told so many
stories by his comrades, and which his imagination peopled with
wonders. In 1511 he bundles up his effects, and sets out in the
direction of the South. The young traveller, falling in with gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
comrades, students roaming the country, and many dangerous
temptations soon feels a serious struggle within. The lusts of
the world and his pious resolutions war with each other. Trembling
for the result, he takes flight, and, in 1513, hides himself in
the little town of Wels in Austria, where he lives in retirement,
devoting himself to the study of the fine arts. The emperor,
Maximilian, happens to pass through the town with a brilliant
suite, and the young poet is quite fascinated with the splendour
of the court. The prince receives him into his hunting train, and
Hans once more forgets himself, under the noisy vaults of the palace
of Insprüch. But his conscience again sounds the alarm, and
the young huntsman, immediately throwing aside his brilliant uniform,
takes his departure, and arrives at Schwatz near Munich.
There, in 1514, at the age of twenty, he composed his first hymn,
"In Honour of God," setting it to a remarkable air. It was received
with great applause. In the course of his journeys, he was
witness to many sad proofs of the abuses under which religion
groaned.</p>

<p>On his return to Nuremberg, Hans commences business, marries,
and becomes the father of a family. When the Reformation breaks
out he turns a listening ear. He cordially welcomes the Holy
Scripture, which had already endeared itself to him as a poet, and
he no longer searches it for images and hymns, but for the light of
truth. To this truth he consecrates his lyre. From a humble stall
in front of one of the gates of the imperial city of Nuremberg, come
forth notes which re-echo over Germany, and everywhere excite a
deep interest in the great revolution which is going forward. The
spiritual songs of Hans Sachs, and his Bible turned into verse,
greatly aided the work. Indeed, it would be difficult to say which
of the two did most for it&mdash;the elector of Saxony, vicegerent of the
empire, or the shoemaker of Nuremberg.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thus, then, there was something in all classes which announced
a Reformation. On all sides signs appeared, and events pressed
forward threatening to overthrow the work of ages of darkness,
and introduce men to a period in which "all things were to become
new." The hierarchical form, which several ages had been
employed in stamping upon the world, was on the eve of being
effaced. The light which had just been discovered had, with inconceivable
rapidity, introduced a number of new ideas into all
countries, and all classes of society gave signs of new life. "O age!"
exclaims Hütten, "studies flourish, and minds awake: Mere life
is joy!"... The human intellect, which had been slumbering for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
so many generations, seemed desirous, by its activity, to redeem the
time which it had lost. To have left it in idleness, without nourishment,
or to have given it no better food than that which had long
maintained its languid existence, would have been to mistake the
nature of man. The human mind having at length perceived what
it was, and what it ought to be, looked boldly at these two states,
and scanned the immense abyss which lay between them. Great
princes were on the throne, the ancient colossus of Rome was tottering
under its own weight, and the old spirit of chivalry was taking
leave of the earth to make way for a new spirit, which breathed
at once on the sanctuaries of knowledge, and on the dwellings of
the poor. The printed Word had taken wing, and been carried, as
the wind does certain seeds, to the most distant regions. The discovery
of the two Indies had enlarged the world.... Every thing
announced that a great revolution was at hand.</p>

<p>But whence will the blow come which is to strike down the
ancient edifice, that a new edifice may arise out of its ruins? Nobody
could say. Who had more wisdom than Frederick? More
science than Reuchlin? More talent than Erasmus? More spirit
and versatility than Hütten? More valour than Seckingen? More
virtue than Cronberg? And yet, neither Frederick, nor Reuchlin,
nor Erasmus, nor Seckingen, nor Hütten, nor Cronberg....
Learned men, princes, warriors, the Church herself, had sapped
some of the foundations: but there they had stopped. The powerful
hand which God had designed to employ was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>All, however, felt that it must soon make its appearance, while
some even pretended to have seen indications of it in the stars.
One class, seeing the miserable state of religion predicted the near
approach of Antichrist. Another class, on the contrary, predicted a
speedy Reformation. The world was waiting.... Luther appeared.</p>

<p>All was ready. God takes ages to prepare his work, but when
the hour is come, accomplishes it by the feeblest instruments. To
do great things by small means, is the law of God. This law,
which appears in every department of nature, is found also in history.
God took the Reformers of the Church, where he had taken
the Apostles. He selected them from that humble class which,
without containing the meanest of the people, is scarcely the
length of citizenship. Every thing must manifest to the world that
the work is not of man, but of God. The Reformer Zuinglius
comes forth from the hut of a shepherd of the Alps, Melancthon, the
Theologian of the Reformation, from the workshop of an armourer,
and Luther from the cottage of a poor miner.</p>

<p>The first stage in a man's life, that in which he is formed and
moulded under the hand of God, is always important, and was so
especially in the case of Luther. There, even at that period, the
whole Reformation existed. The different phases of that great
work succeeded each other in the soul of him who was the instrument
of accomplishing it, before it was actually accomplished. The
knowledge of the Reformation which took place in Luther's heart
is the only key to the Reformation of the Church. We must
study the particular work, if we would attain to a knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the general work. Those who neglect the one will never know more
than the form and exterior of the other. They may acquire a knowledge
of certain events and certain results, but the intrinsic nature
of the revival they cannot know, because the living principle which
formed the soul of it, is hidden from them. Let us then study the
Reformation in Luther, before studying it in events which changed
the face of Christendom.</p>

<p>In the village of Mora, towards the forests of Thuringia, and not
far from the spot where Boniface, the Apostle of Germany, began
to proclaim the gospel, there existed, and, undoubtedly, had existed
for ages, an ancient and numerous family of the name of Luther.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
The eldest son, as usual with the peasantry of Thuringia, always
succeeded to the house and the paternal plot, while the younger
members of the family set out in quest of a livelihood. John Luther
having married Margaret Lindemann, daughter of an inhabitant of
Neustadt, in the bishopric of Warzburg, the married couple removed
from the plains of Isenach, and fixed their residence in the little
town of Eisleben, in Saxony, in order to gain their bread by the
sweat of their brow.</p>

<p>Seckendorff relates, on the testimony of Robhan, superintendant
of Isenach in 1601, that Luther's mother, thinking she was still far
from her time, had gone to the fair of Eisleben, and there, unexpectedly,
gave birth to a son. Notwithstanding of the credit due
to such a man as Seckendorff, this account appears not to be correct.
In fact, none of the older biographers of Luther make any mention
of it. Besides, Mora is more than twenty-four leagues distant
from Eisleben, and persons in the circumstances in which Luther's
mother then was seldom are disposed to take such long journeys
<i>to go to the fair</i>. In fine, the account seems quite at variance with
Luther's own statement.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>John Luther was an upright, straightforward, hard-working
man, with a firmness of character bordering on obstinacy. Of a
more cultivated mind than usual with persons of his class, he
was a great reader. Books were then rare. But he never let
pass any opportunity of procuring them. They were his relaxation
in the intervals of repose from hard and long-continued labour.
Margaret possessed the virtues which adorn honest and
pious women. She was remarked, in particular, for her modesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her fear of God, and her spirit of prayer. The mothers of the
place regarded her as a model whom they ought to imitate.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>It is not exactly known how long this couple had been fixed at
Eisleben, when, on the 10th November, an hour before midnight,
Margaret gave birth to a son. Melancthon often questioned the
mother of his friend as to the period of his birth. "I remember
the day and the hour very well," would she reply; "but for the
year, I am not certain of it." Luther's brother, James, an honest
and upright man, has stated, that, in the opinion of all the
family, Martin was born in the year of Christ 1483, on the 10th
November, being St. Martin's eve.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The first thought of the pious
parents was to take the infant which God had given them, and
dedicate it to God in holy baptism. On the following day, which
happened to be a Tuesday, the father, with gratitude and joy,
carried his son to St. Peter's church, where he received the seal of
his dedication to the Lord. He was named Martin in honour of
the day.</p>

<p>Young Martin was not six months old when his parents quitted
Eisleben for Mansfeld, which is only five leagues distant. The
mines of Mansfeld were then much famed, and John Luther, a
labouring man, feeling that he might perhaps be called to rear a
numerous family, hoped he might there more easily gain a livelihood.
It was in this town that the intellect and powers of young
Luther received their first development; here his activity began
to be displayed, and his disposition to be manifested by what he
said and did. The plains of Mansfeld, the banks of the Wipper,
were the scenes of his first sports with his playmates.</p>

<p>The commencement of their residence at Mansfeld was attended
with painful privations to honest John and his wife; for
they lived some time in great poverty. "My parents," says the
Reformer, "were very poor. My father was a poor wood-cutter,
and my mother often carried his wood on her back to procure
subsistence for us children. The toil they endured for us was
severe, even to blood." The example of parents whom he respected,
and the habits in which they trained him, early accustomed
Luther to exertion and frugality. Often, doubtless, he accompanied
his mother to the wood, and made up his little faggot
also.</p>

<p>Promises are given to the just man's labour, and John Luther
experienced the reality of them. Having become somewhat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
easy in his circumstances, he established two smelting furnaces at
Mansfeld. Around these furnaces young Martin grew up; and
the return which they yielded enabled his father, at a later period,
to provide for his studies. "The spiritual founder of Christendom,"
says worthy Mathesius, "was to come forth from a family
of miners, an image of what God purposed, when he employed
him to cleanse the sons of Levi, and purify them in his furnaces
like gold."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Universally respected for his integrity, his blameless
life, and good sense, John Luther was made a counsellor of
Mansfeld, the capital of the county of that name. Too great
wretchedness might have weighed down the spirit of the child,
but the easy circumstances of the paternal roof expanded his heart,
and elevated his character.</p>

<p>John availed himself of his new situation to cultivate the society
which he preferred. He set great value on educated men,
and often invited the clergymen and teachers of the place to his
table. His house presented an example of one of those societies
of simple citizens which did honour to Germany at the commencement
of the sixteenth century, and, as a mirror, reflected the numerous
images which succeeded each other on the troubled stage
of that time. It was not lost on the child. The sight of men to
whom so much respect was shown in his father's house must,
doubtless, on more than one occasion, have awakened in young
Martin's heart an ambitious desire one day to become a school-master
or a man of learning.</p>

<p>As soon as he was of an age to receive some instruction, his
parents sought to give him the knowledge and inspire him with
the fear of God, and train him in Christian virtues. Their utmost
care was devoted to his primary domestic education.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> This,
however, was not the sole object of their tender solicitude.</p>

<p>His father, desirous of seeing him acquire the elements of knowledge
for which he himself had so much esteem, invoked the Divine
blessing on his head, and sent him to school. As Martin was
still a very little boy, his father or Nicolas Emler, a young man of
Mansfeld, often carried him in their arms to the house of George
Emilius, and went again to fetch him. Emler afterwards married
one of Luther's sisters.</p>

<p>The piety of the parents, their activity and strict virtue, gave
a happy impulse to the boy, making him of a grave and attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
spirit. The system of education which then prevailed employed
fear and punishment as its leading stimulants. Margaret, though
sometimes approving the too strict discipline of her husband, often
opened her maternal arms to Martin, to console him in his tears.
She herself occasionally carried to excess that precept of Divine
wisdom, which says, "He that spareth the rod hateth his son."
The impetuous temper of the child often led to frequent reproof
and correction. "My parents," says Luther, in after life, "treated
me harshly, and made me very timid. My mother one day chastised
me about a filbert till the blood came. They believed with
all their heart they were doing right, but they could not discriminate
between dispositions, though this is necessary in order to
know when and how punishments should be inflicted."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The poor child's treatment at school was not less severe. His
master one morning beat him fifteen times in succession. "It is
necessary," said Luther, when mentioning the fact, "it is necessary
to chastise children; but it is necessary, at the same time, to
love them." With such an education, Luther early learned to
despise the allurements of a sensual life. "He who is to become
great must begin with little,"<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> justly remarks one of his earliest
biographers; "and if children are brought up with too much delicacy
and tenderness, it does them harm all the rest of their life."</p>

<p>Martin learned something at school. He was taught the heads
of the Catechism, the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed,
the Lord's Prayer, hymns, forms of prayer, and the <i>Donat</i>. This
last was a Latin grammar, composed in the fourth century by
Donatus, St. Jerome's master; and having been improved in the
eleventh century by a French monk, named Remigius, was long
in high repute as a school-book. He moreover conned the Ciseo-Janus,
a very singular almanac, composed in the tenth or
eleventh century. In short, he learned all that was taught in the
Latin school of Mansfeld.</p>

<p>But the child seems not to have been brought to God. The
only religious sentiment which could be discovered in him was
that of fear. Whenever he heard Jesus Christ mentioned he
grew pale with terror; for the Saviour had been represented to
him as an angry Judge. This servile fear, so foreign to genuine
religion, perhaps predisposed him for the glad tidings of the gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and for the joy which he afterwards experienced when he became
acquainted with him who is meek and lowly in heart.</p>

<p>John Luther longed to make his son a learned man. The new
light, which began to radiate in all directions, penetrated even
the cottage of the miner of Mansfield, and there awakened ambitious
thoughts. The remarkable disposition, and persevering
application of his son, inspired John with the most brilliant hopes.
Accordingly, in 1497, when Martin had completed his fourteenth
year, his father resolved to part with him, and send him to a
school of the Franciscans at Magdebourg. Margaret behoved, of
course, to consent, and Martin prepared to quit the paternal
roof.</p>

<p>Magdebourg was like a new world to Martin. Amid numerous
privations, (for he had scarcely the means of subsistence,) he read
and attended lectures; André Prolés, provincial of the Augustine
Order, was then preaching with great fervour on the necessity of
reforming religion and the Church. He, however, was not the
person who deposited in the young man's soul the first germ of
those ideas which afterwards expanded in it.</p>

<p>This period was a kind of severe apprenticeship to Luther.
Launched upon the world at fourteen, without friend or patron,
he trembled in presence of his masters, and, during the hours of
recreation, painfully begged his food with children as poor as himself.
"I and my comrades," says he, "begged a little food for
our subsistence. One day, at the season when the Church celebrates
the birth of Jesus Christ, we were in a body scouring the
neighbouring villages, going from house to house, and, in four
parts, singing the ordinary hymns on the Babe at Bethlehem. We
stopped before a peasant's cottage, which stood by itself at the
extremity of a village. The peasant, hearing us singing our Christmas
carols, came out with some provisions which he meant to
give us, and asked, in a gruff voice, and a harsh tone, 'Where
are you, boys?' His tones frightened us, and we took to our heels.
We had no cause for fear; for the peasant was sincere in his
offer of assistance: but our hearts were, no doubt, made timid by
the menaces and tyranny with which masters at this period
oppressed their scholars; hence the sudden fright which seized us.
At last, however, the peasant still continuing to call us, we
stopped, laid aside our fear, and, running up to him, received the
food which he intended for us." "In the same way," adds
Luther, "are we wont to tremble and flee when our conscience
is guilty and alarmed. Then we are afraid even of the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
which is offered to us, and of those who are friendly to us, and
would do us all sorts of kindness."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>A year had scarcely passed, when John and Margaret, on being
made aware of the difficulties which their son had in living in
Magdebourg, sent him to Isenach, where there was a celebrated
school, and they had a number of relations.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> They had other
children; and though their circumstances had improved, they
were unable to maintain their son in a strange town. The forges
and late hours of John Luther did no more than keep the family
at Mansfield. It was hoped that Martin would find a livelihood
more easily at Isenach, but he was not more successful. His
relations in the town did not trouble themselves about him. Perhaps
their own poverty made them unable to give him any assistance.</p>

<p>When the scholar felt the gnawings of hunger he had no resource
but to do as at Magdebourg,&mdash;to join his fellow-students,
and sing with them before the houses for a morsel of bread. This
custom of the time of Luther has been preserved, even to our
day, in several towns of Germany, where the voices of the boys
sometimes produce a most harmonious chant. Instead of bread,
poor modest Martin often received only hard words. Then, overcome
with sadness, he shed many tears in secret, unable to think
of the future without trembling.</p>

<p>One day, in particular, he had been repulsed from three houses,
and was preparing, without having broken his fast, to return to
his lodging, when, on arriving at St. George's Square, he halted,
and, absorbed in gloomy thoughts, stood motionless before the
house of an honest burgher.</p>

<p>Will it be necessary, from want of bread, to give up study, and
go and work with his father in the mines of Mansfeld? Suddenly
a door opens, and a female is seen on the threshold,&mdash;it was the
wife of Conrad Cotta, the daughter of the burgomaster of Ilefeld.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Her name was Ursula. The Chronicles of Isenach call her "the
pious Shunammite," in allusion to her who so earnestly pressed
the prophet Elisha to eat bread with her. Previous to this the
Christian Shunammite had more than once observed young Martin
in the assemblies of the faithful, and been touched by the sweetness
of his voice, and his devout behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> She had just heard
the harsh language addressed to the poor scholar, and seeing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in sadness before her door, she came to his assistance, beckoned
him to enter, and set food before him to appease his hunger.</p>

<p>Conrad approved of the benevolence of his wife, and was even
so much pleased with the society of young Luther, that some days
after he took him home to his house. From this moment his
studies were secure. He will not be obliged to return to the
mines of Mansfeld, and bury the talent with which God has
entrusted him. When he no longer knew what was to become of
him God opened to him the heart and the home of a Christian
family. This event helped to give him that confidence in God
which in after life the strongest tempests could not shake.</p>

<p>In the house of Cotta, Luther was introduced to a mode of life
very different from that which he had hitherto known. He there
led an easy existence, exempt from want and care. His mind
became more serene, his disposition more lively, and his heart
more open. His whole being expanded to the mild rays of charity,
and began to beat with life, joy, and happiness. His prayers
were more ardent, and his thirst for knowledge more intense. He
made rapid progress.</p>

<p>To literature and science he added the charms of art. Those
who are designed by God to act upon their contemporaries are
themselves, in the first instance, seized and carried along by all
the tendencies of their age. Luther learned to play on the flute
and the lute. The latter instrument he often accompanied with
his fine counter voice, thus enlivening his heart in moments of
sadness. He took pleasure also in employing his notes to testify
his gratitude to his adopted mother, who was very fond of music.
His own love of it continued to old age, and both the words and
the music of some of the finest anthems which Germany possesses
are his composition. Some have even been translated into our
language.</p>

<p>Happy time for the young man! Luther always remembered it
with emotion. Many years after, a son of Conrad having come
to study at Wittemberg, when the poor scholar of Isenach had
become the doctor of his age, he gladly received him at his table
and under his roof. He wished to pay back to the son part of
what he had received from the parents. It was while thinking of
the Christian woman who gave him food when all besides repulsed
him, that he gave utterance to this fine expression, "Earth
has nothing gentler than the female heart in which piety dwells."</p>

<p>Luther was never ashamed of the days when, pressed by hunger,
he was under the necessity of begging for his studies and his
maintenance. So far from this, he, on the contrary, reflected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gratitude on the great poverty of his youth. He regarded it as
one of the means which God had employed to make him what he
afterwards became, and he felt thankful for it. The poor youths
who were obliged to follow the same course touched his heart.
"Do not," said he, "despise the boys who sing before your houses,
and ask 'panem propter Deum,' bread for the love of God; I
have done it myself. It is true that at a later period, my father,
with great love and kindness, kept me at the University of Erfurt,
maintaining me by the sweat of his brow; still I once was a
poor beggar. And now by means of my pen, I am come thus far,
that I would not change situations with the Grand Turk himself.
Nay, more, were all the goods of the world piled up one above another,
I would not take them in exchange for what I have. And
yet, I should not be where I am, if I had not been at school and
learned to write." Thus, in these first humble beginnings this
great man traced the origin of his fame. He fears not to remind
us that that voice whose accents made the empire and the world
to tremble, had once begged a morsel of bread in the streets of a
poor city. The Christian takes pleasure in such recollections, as
reminding him that it is in God he must glory.</p>

<p>The strength of his intellect, and the liveliness of his imagination,
soon enabled him to outstrip all his fellow-students.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> His
progress was particularly rapid in ancient languages, eloquence,
and poetry. He wrote essays and made verses. Lively, complaisant,
and what is called good-hearted, he was a great favourite
with his masters and his comrades.</p>

<p>Among the professors, he attached himself particularly to John
Trebonius, a learned man of pleasing manners, who showed youth
those attentions which are so well fitted to encourage them. Martin
had remarked, that when Trebonius entered the class, he took off
his hat, and bowed to the students;&mdash;great condescension in
those pedantic times! This had pleased the young man, and made
him feel that he was not a mere cipher. The respect of the master
had made the pupil rise in his own estimation. The colleagues
of Trebonius, who had not the same custom of taking off their
hats, having one day expressed their astonishment at his extreme
condescension, he replied, (and the reply made no less impression
on young Luther,) "Among these youths are men whom God will
one day make burgomasters, chancellors, doctors, and magistrates;
and though you do not yet see them with their badges of office, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
is right, however, to show them respect." No doubt, the young
student listened with pleasure to these words, and even then, perhaps,
saw himself with a doctor's cap on his head.</p>

<p>Luther had attained his eighteenth year. He had tasted the
pleasures of literature, and burning with eagerness to learn, he
sighed after a university, and longed to repair to one of those
fountains of science, at which he might quench his thirst for knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
His father wished him to study law, and already saw
him filling an honourable station among his fellow-citizens, gaining
the favour of princes, and making a figure on the theatre of
the world. It was resolved that the young student should repair
to Erfurt.</p>

<p>Luther arrived at this university in the year 1501. Jadocus,
surnamed the Doctor of the Isenach, was then teaching the scholastic
philosophy with much success. Melancthon regrets that
the only thing then taught at Erfurt should have been a dialectics
bristling with difficulties. He thinks that if Luther had found
other professors there, if he had been trained in the milder and
calmer discipline of true philosophy, it might have moderated and
softened the vehemence of his nature.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The new scholar began to
study the philosophy of the middle ages in the writings of Occam,
Scotus, Bonaventura, and Thomas Aquinas. At a later period he
had a thorough disgust for all this scholasticism. The very name
of Aristotle, pronounced in his hearing, filled him with indignation;
and he even went the length of saying, that if Aristotle was
not a man, he would have no hesitation in taking him for the
devil. But his mind, in its eagerness for learning, stood in need
of better nourishment, and he began to study the splendid monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of antiquity, the writings of Cicero and Virgil, and the other
classics. He was not contented, like the common run of students,
with committing the productions of these writers to memory. He
endeavoured, above all, to enter into their thoughts; to imbue
himself with the spirit which animated them; to appropriate their
wisdom; to comprehend the end of their writings; and enrich
his understanding with their weighty sentiments and brilliant
images. He often put questions to his professors, and soon outstripped
his fellow students.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Possessed of a retentive memory
and a fertile imagination, whatever he read or heard remained
ever after present to his mind, as if he had actually seen it. "So
shone Luther in his youth. The whole university," says Melancthon,
"admired his genius."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>But even at that period this young man of eighteen did not
confine his labours to the cultivation of his intellect. He had that
serious thought, that uplifted heart, which God bestows on those
whom he destines to be his most faithful servants. Luther felt
that he was dependent on God&mdash;a simple, yet powerful, conviction&mdash;the
source at once of profound humility and great achievements.
He fervently invoked the Divine blessing on his labours.
Each morning he began the day with prayer, then he went to
church, and on his return set to study, losing not a moment during
the course of the day. "To pray well," he was wont to say, "is
more than the half of my study."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Every moment which the young student could spare from his
academical labours was spent in the library of the university.
Books were still rare, and he felt it a great privilege to be able to
avail himself of the treasures amassed in this vast collection.
One day (he had then been two years at Erfurt, and was twenty
years of age) he opens several books of the library, one after the
other, to see who their authors were. One of the volumes which
he opens in its turn attracts his attention. He has never before
seen one like it. He reads the title, ... it is a Bible! a rare
book, at that time unknown.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> His interest is strongly excited;
he is perfectly astonished to find in this volume any thing more
than those fragments of gospels and epistles which the Church
has selected to be read publicly in the churches every Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
day. Hitherto he had believed that these formed the whole
word of God. But here are so many pages, chapters, and
books, of which he had no idea! His heart beats as he holds in
his hand all this divinely-inspired Scripture, and he turns over all
these divine leaves with feelings which cannot be described. The
first page on which he fixes his attention tells him the history of
Hannah and young Samuel. He reads, and his soul is filled with
joy to overflowing. The child whom his parents lend to Jehovah
for all the days of his life; the song of Hannah, in which she declares
that the Lord lifts up the poor from the dust, and the needy
from the dunghill, that he may set him with princes; young
Samuel growing up in the presence of the Lord; the whole of this
history, the whole of the volume which he has discovered, make
him feel in a way he has never done before. He returns home,
his heart full. "Oh!" thinks he, "would it please God one day
to give me such a book for my own!"<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Luther as yet did not
know either Greek or Hebrew; for it is not probable that he
studied these languages during the first two or three years of his
residence at the university. The Bible which had so overjoyed
him was in Latin. Soon returning to his treasure in the library,
he reads and re-reads, and in his astonishment and joy returns
to read again. The first rays of a new truth were then dawning
upon him.</p>

<p>In this way God has put him in possession of His word. He
has discovered the book of which he is one day to give his countrymen
that admirable translation in which Germany has now
for three centuries perused the oracles of God. It was perhaps
the first time that any hand had taken down this precious volume
from the place which it occupied in the library of Erfurt. This
book, lying on the unknown shelves of an obscure chamber, is to
become the book of life to a whole people. The Reformation was
hid in that Bible.</p>

<p>This happened the same year that Luther obtained his first
academical degree, viz., that of Bachelor. The excessive fatigue
which he had undergone in preparing for his trials brought on a
dangerous illness. Death seemed to be approaching, and solemn
thoughts occupied his mind. He believed that his earthly course
was about to terminate. There was a general lamentation for
the young man. What a pity to see so many hopes so soon extinguished!
Several friends came to visit him in his sickness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
among others a priest, a venerable old man, who had with interest
followed the student of Mansfeld in his labours and academic life.
Luther was unable to conceal the thought which agitated him.
"Soon," said he, "I will be called away from this world." But
the old man kindly replied, "My dear bachelor, take courage; you
will not die of this illness. Our God will yet make you a man, who,
in his turn, will console many other men. For God lays his cross
on him whom he loves, and those who bear it patiently acquire
much wisdom."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> These words made a deep impression on the
sick youth. When so near death he hears the lips of a priest
reminding him that God, as Samuel's mother had said, lifts up the
miserable. The old man has poured sweet consolation into his
heart and revived his spirits; he will never forget him. "This
was the first prediction the Doctor heard," says Mathesius,
Luther's friend, who relates the fact; "and he often mentioned
it." It is easy to understand what Mathesius means by calling
it a prediction.</p>

<p>When Luther recovered, something within him had undergone
a change. The Bible, his illness, and the words of the old priest,
seemed to have made a new appeal to him. As yet, however,
there was nothing decided in his mind. He continued his studies,
and, in 1505, took his degree of Master of Arts, or Doctor in
Philosophy. The University of Erfurt was then the most celebrated
in Germany,&mdash;the others in comparison with it being only
inferior schools. The ceremony was, as usual, performed with
great pomp. A procession with torches came to do homage to
Luther.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The fête was superb, and all was joy. Luther, encouraged,
perhaps, by these honours, was disposed to devote himself
entirely to law, agreeably to his father's wish.</p>

<p>But God willed otherwise. While Luther was occupied with
other studies, while he began to teach the physics and ethics of
Aristotle, and other branches of philosophy, his heart ceased not
to cry to him that piety was the one thing needful, and that he
ought above all to make sure of his salvation. He was aware of
the displeasure which God testifies against sin; he remembered
the punishments which he denounces against the sinner; and he
asked himself in fear, whether he was sure of possessing the Divine
favour. His conscience answered, No! His character was prompt
and decided; he resolved to do all that might be necessary to
give him a sure hope of immortality. Two events, which happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in succession, shook his soul, and precipitated his determination.</p>

<p>Among his friends at the university was one named Alexis,
with whom he was very intimate. One morning it was rumoured
in Erfurt that Alexis had been assassinated. Deeply moved at
the sudden loss of his friend, he puts the question to himself&mdash;What
would become of me were I called thus suddenly? The
question fills him with the greatest dismay.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This was in the summer of 1505. Luther, left at liberty by the
ordinary recess of the university, resolved on a journey to Mansfeld,
to revisit the loved abodes of his infancy, and embrace his
parents. Perhaps he also wished to open his heart to his father,
and sound him as to the design which was beginning to form in
his mind, and obtain a consent to his embracing another calling.
He foresaw all the difficulties which awaited him. The indolent
habits of the majority of priests displeased the active miner of
Mansfeld. Besides, ecclesiastics were little esteemed in the world;
most of them had but scanty incomes, and the father, who had
made many sacrifices to maintain his son at the university, and
who saw him at twenty a public teacher in a celebrated school,
was not disposed to renounce the hopes which his pride was cherishing.</p>

<p>We know not what passed during Luther's visit at Mansfeld.
Perhaps the decided wish of his father made him afraid to open
his heart to him. He again quitted the paternal roof to go and
take his seat on the benches of the university, and had reached
within a short distance of Erfurt, when he was overtaken by one
of those violent storms which are not unfrequent among these
mountains. The thunder bursts, and strikes close by his side.
Luther throws himself on his knees. It may be his hour is come,
Death, judgment, and eternity, surround him with all their terrors,
and speak to him with a voice which he can no longer resist.
"Wrapt in agony, and in the terror of death," as he himself describes
it,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> he makes a vow, if he is delivered from this danger to
abandon the world, and give himself entirely to God. After he
had risen from the ground, still continuing to see that death which
must one day overtake him, he examines himself seriously, and
asks what he ought to do.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The thoughts which formerly agitated
him return with full force. He has endeavoured, it is true,
to fulfil all his duties. But in what state is his soul? Can he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
appear with a polluted heart before the tribunal of a God so
greatly to be feared? He must become holy, and, accordingly, he
now thirsts for holiness as he had thirsted for science. But where
is it to be found? How shall he acquire it? The university has
furnished him with the means of satisfying his desire of knowledge.
Who will extinguish the agony, the flame which is consuming
him? To what school of holiness must he bend his steps?
He will go into a cloister; the monastic life will save him. How
often has he heard tell of its power to transform a heart, to sanctify
a sinner, to make a man perfect! He will enter a monastic
order. He will then become holy, and in that way secure eternal
life.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Such was the event which changed the calling and all the destinies
of Luther. We here recognise the finger of God. It was
his mighty hand which threw down on the high road this young
Master of Arts, this candidate for the bar, this future lawyer, in
order to give an entirely new direction to his life. Rubianus, one
of Luther's friends, wrote to him at a later period:&mdash;"Divine Providence
had a view to what you were one day to become, when,
as you were returning from your parents, the fire of heaven made
you fall to the ground like another Paul, near the town of Erfurt,
and carrying you off from our society, threw you into the Order of
Augustine." Analogous circumstances thus signalised the conversion
of Paul and Luther, the two greatest instruments which
Divine Providence has employed in the two greatest revolutions
which have taken place upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Luther again enters Erfurt. His resolution is immovable, and
yet it is not without a pang he is going to break ties which are
dear to him. He gives no hint to any one of his intentions. But
one evening he invites his friends in the university to a cheerful
and frugal repast. Music once more enlivens their social intercourse.
It is Luther's adieu to the world. Henceforth, instead
of those loved companions of pleasure and toil&mdash;monks; instead
of those cheerful and intellectual conversations&mdash;the silence of the
cloister; instead of that enchanting music&mdash;the grave notes of the
tranquil chapel. God demands it; all must be sacrificed. Yet,
for this last time, once more the joys of youth. His friends are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
full of glee. Luther even leads them on. But at the moment
when they are abandoning themselves to mirth and frolic, the
young man becomes unable any longer to restrain the serious
thoughts which occupy his heart. He speaks.... He makes
known his intention to his astonished friends, who endeavour, but
in vain, to combat it. That same night, Luther, afraid perhaps of
importunate solicitation, quits his lodgings, leaving behind him all
his effects and all his books, with the exception of Virgil and
Plautus, (as yet he had no Bible.) Virgil and Plautus! Epic and
Comedy! singular representation of Luther's mind. In fact, there
was in him a whole epic, a beautiful, splendid, and sublime poem;
but being naturally inclined to gayety, pleasantry, and broad humour,
he mingled more than one familiar trait with the solemn and
magnificent groundwork of his life.</p>

<p>Furnished with these two books he proceeds alone, in the dark,
to the convent of the Eremites of St. Augustine, and asks to
be received. The door opens and closes, and he is separated
for ever from his parents, his fellow-students, and the world.
This took place on the 17th August 1505, when Luther's age was
twenty-one years and nine months.</p>

<p>At length he was with God. His soul was in safety. This
holiness, so earnestly longed for, he was now to find. At the
sight of this young doctor, the monks were all admiration, and
extolled him for his courage and contempt of the world.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Luther,
meanwhile, did not forget his friends. He wrote to take leave of
them and the world, and the next day despatched these letters,
with the clothes he had hitherto worn, and his diploma of Master
of Arts, which he returned to the university, that nothing might
in future remind him of the world which he had abandoned.</p>

<p>His friends at Erfurt were thunderstruck. Must so distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a genius go and hide himself in this monastic life&mdash;more
properly, a kind of death?<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In deep sorrow they hastened to the
convent, in the hope of inducing Luther to retrace the distressing
step which he had taken; but all was useless. The gates were
closed, and a month passed before any one was permitted to see
or speak to the new monk.</p>

<p>Luther had hastened to acquaint his parents with the great
change which had just occurred in his life. His father was thunderstruck.
He trembled for his son,&mdash;so Luther himself informs
us in his book on Monastic Vows, which he dedicated to his father.
His weakness, his youth, the ardour of his passions, everything,
in short, made him fear that after the first moment of enthusiasm,
the indolence of the cloister would make the youth fall
either into despair, or into grievous faults. He knew that this
mode of life had proved fatal to many. Besides, the counsellor-miner
of Mansfield had other views for his son. He was proposing
a rich and honourable marriage for him&mdash;and, lo! all his ambitious
projects are in one night overthrown by this imprudent
action.</p>

<p>John wrote his son a very angry letter, in which, as Luther
himself tells us, he <i>thou'd</i> him whereas he had <i>you'd</i> him ever since
he had taken his degree of Master of Arts. He withdrew all his
favour from him, and declared him disinherited of a father's affection.
In vain did the friends of John Luther, and doubtless his
wife also, endeavour to mollify him; in vain did they say to him,
"If you are willing to make some sacrifice to God, let it be the
best and dearest thing that you have&mdash;your son&mdash;your Isaac."
The inexorable counsellor of Mansfeld would hear nothing.</p>

<p>Some time after, (the statement is given by Luther in a sermon
which he preached at Wittemberg, 20th January 1544,) the
plague broke out, and deprived John Luther of two of his sons. On
the back of these bereavements, while the father's heart was torn
with grief, some one came and told him, "The monk of Erfurt
also is dead!" His friends took advantage of the circumstance
to bring back the father's heart to the novice. "If it is a false
alarm," said they, "at least sanctify your affliction by consenting
sincerely to your son's being a monk." "Well, well!" replied John
Luther, his heart broken, and still half rebellions; "and God grant
him all success." At a later period, when Luther, who had been
reconciled to his father, told him of the event which had led him
to rush into monastic orders,&mdash;"God grant," replied the honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
miner, "that what you took for a sign from heaven may not have
been only a phantom of the devil!"<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>At this time Luther was not in possession of that which was
afterwards to make him the Reformer of the Church. His entrance
into the convent proves this. It was an action done in
the spirit of an age out of which he was soon to be instrumental
in raising the Church. Though destined to become the
teacher of the world, he was still its servile imitator. A new
stone was placed on the edifice of superstition by the very hand
which was soon to overturn it. Luther was seeking salvation in
himself, in human practices and observances, not knowing that
salvation is wholly of God. He was seeking his own righteousness
and his own glory, and overlooking the righteousness and
glory of the Lord. But what he as yet knew not he soon afterwards
learned. That immense change which substituted God
and His wisdom in his heart for the world and its traditions, and
which prepared the mighty revolution of which he was the most
illustrious instrument, took place in the cloister of Erfurt.</p>

<p>Martin Luther, on entering the convent, changed his name to
that of Augustine.</p>

<p>The monks had received him with joy. It was no small satisfaction
to their self-love to see the university abandoned for a
house of their order, and that by one of the most distinguished
teachers. Nevertheless, they treated him harshly, and assigned
him the meanest tasks. They wished to humble the doctor of
philosophy, and teach him that his science did not raise him above
his brethren. They thought, moreover, they would thus prevent
him from spending his time in studies from which the convent
could not reap any advantage. The <i>ci-devant</i> Master of Arts
behoved to perform the functions of watchman, to open and shut
the gates, wind up the clocks, sweep the church, and clean up the
rooms.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Then when the poor monk, who was at once porter,
sacristan, and house-hold servant to the cloister, had finished his
task&mdash;<i>"Cum sacco per civitatem"</i>&mdash;"To the town with the bag,"
exclaimed the friars; and then, with his bread-bag on his shoulders,
he walked up and down over all the streets of Erfurt, begging
from house to house, obliged, perhaps, to present himself at
the doors of those who had been his friends or inferiors. On his
return, he had either to shut himself up in a low narrow cell, looking
out on a plot only a few yards in extent, or to resume his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
menial offices. But he submitted to all. Disposed by temperament
to give himself entirely to whatever he undertook, when he
turned monk he did it with his whole soul. How, moreover, could
he think of sparing his body, or of having regard to what might
satisfy the flesh? That was not the way to acquire the humility
and holiness in quest of which he had come within the walls of
the cloister.</p>

<p>The poor monk, worn out with fatigue, was eager to seize any
moment which he could steal from his servile occupations, and devote
it to the acquisition of knowledge. Gladly did he retire into
a corner, and give himself up to his beloved studies. But the
friars soon found him out, gathered around him, grumbled at him,
and pushed him away to his labours, saying, "Along! along!
it is not by studying, but by begging bread, corn, eggs, fish, flesh,
and money, that a friar makes himself useful to his convent."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Luther submitted, laid aside his books, and again took up his
bag. Far from repenting of having subjected himself to such a
yoke, his wish was to bring it to a successful result. At this period,
the inflexible perseverance with which he ever after followed out
the resolutions which he had once formed, began to be developed.
The resistance which he made to rude assaults gave strong energy
to his will. God exercised him in small things that he might be
able to stand firm in great things. Besides, in preparing to
deliver his age from the miserable superstitions under which it
groaned, it was necessary that he should feel the weight of them.
In order to empty the cup he behoved to drink it to the dregs.</p>

<p>This severe apprenticeship, however, did not last so long as
Luther might have feared. The prior of the convent, on the intercession
of the university of which Luther was a member, relieved
him from the mean functions which had been imposed on
him, and the young monk resumed his studies with new zeal.
The writings of the Fathers, particularly those of Augustine,
engaged his attention; the Commentary of this illustrious doctor
on the Psalms, and his treatise "On the Letter and the Spirit,"
being his special favourites. Nothing struck him more than the
sentiments of this Father on the corruption of the human will, and
on Divine grace. His own experience convincing him of the
reality of this corruption, and the necessity of this grace, the words
of Augustine found a ready response in his heart; and could he
have been of any other school than that of Jesus Christ, it had
doubtless been the school of the doctor of Hippo. The works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Peter D'Ailly and Gabriel Biel he almost knew by heart. He
was struck with a remark of the former&mdash;that had not the Church
decided otherwise, it would have been much better to admit that
in the Lord's Supper bread and wine are truly received, and not
mere accidents.</p>

<p>He likewise carefully studied the theologians, Occam and Gerson,
who both express themselves so freely on the authority of
the popes. To this reading he joined other exercises. In public
discussions he was heard unravelling the most complicated reasonings,
and winding his way through labyrinths where others
could find no outlet. All who heard him were filled with admiration.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>But he had entered the cloister, not to acquire the reputation of
a great genius, but in quest of the food of piety.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> These labours
he accordingly regarded as supernumerary.</p>

<p>But the thing in which he delighted above all others was to draw
wisdom at the pure fountain of the word of God. In the convent
he found a Bible fastened to a chain, and was ever returning
to this chained Bible. He had a very imperfect comprehension of
the Word, but still it was his most pleasant reading. Sometimes
he spent a whole day in meditating on a single passage; at other
times he learned passages of the Prophets by heart. His great
desire was, that the writings of the apostles and prophets might
help to give him a knowledge of the will of God, increase the fear
which he had for his name, and nourish his faith by the sure testimony
of the Word.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Apparently at this period he began to study the Scriptures
in the original tongues, and thereby lay the foundation of the
most perfect and the most useful of his labours, the translation
of the Bible. He used a Hebrew Lexicon which Reuchlin had
just published. His first guide was probably John Lange, a friar
of the convent, versed in Greek and Hebrew, and with whom he
always maintained a close intimacy.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> He also made great use
of the learned Commentaries of Nicolas Lyra, who died in 1340,
and hence the saying of Pflug, afterwards Bishop of Naumbourg,
"Had not Lyra played the lyre, Luther had never danced. <i>Si
Lyra non lyrasset, Lutherus non saltasset.</i>"</p>

<p>The young monk studied so closely and ardently that he often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
omitted to say his Hours during two or three weeks. Then becoming
alarmed at the thought of having transgressed the rules
of his order, he shut himself up to make amends for his negligence,
and commenced conscientiously repeating all the omitted
Hours, without thinking of meat or drink. On one occasion his
sleep went from him for seven weeks.</p>

<p>Earnestly intent on acquiring the holiness in quest of which
he had entered the cloister, Luther addicted himself to the ascetic
life in its fullest rigour, seeking to crucify the flesh by fastings, macerations,
and vigils.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Shut up in his cell as in a prison, he
struggled without intermission against the evil thoughts and evil
propensities of his heart. A little bread and a herring were often
all his food. Indeed, he was naturally very temperate. Often
when he had no thought of purchasing heaven by abstinence, have
his friends seen him content himself with the coarsest provisions,
and even remain four days in succession without eating or drinking.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
We have this on the testimony of a very credible witness,
Melancthon, and we may judge from it what opinion to form of the
fables which ignorance and prejudice have circulated concerning
Luther's intemperance. At the period of which we treat there is
no sacrifice he would have declined to make, in order to become
holy and purchase heaven.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> When Luther, after he had become
Reformer, says that heaven is not purchased, he well knew what
he meant. "Truly," wrote he to George, Duke of Saxony, "truly
I was a pious monk, and followed the rules of my order more
strictly than I can tell. If ever monk had got to heaven by
monkery, I had been that monk. In this all the monks of my
acquaintance will bear me witness. Had the thing continued much
longer I had become a martyr unto death, through vigils, prayer,
reading, and other labours."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>We are touching on the period which made Luther a new man,
and which, revealing to him the immensity of the Divine love,
fitted him for proclaiming it to the world.</p>

<p>The peace which Luther had come in search of he found neither
in the tranquillity of the cloister nor in monastic perfection. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wished to be assured of his salvation; it was the great want of
his soul, and without it he could have no repose. But the fears
which had agitated him when in the world, followed him into his
cell. Nay, they were even increased; the least cry of his heart
raising a loud echo under the silent vaults of the cloister. God
had brought him thither that he might learn to know himself, and
to despair of his own strength and virtue. His conscience, enlightened
by the Divine word, told him what it was to be holy; but he
was filled with alarm at not finding, either in his heart or his life,
that image of holiness which he had contemplated with admiration
in the word of God; a sad discovery made by every man
who is in earnest! No righteousness within, no righteousness without,
everywhere omission, sin, defilement.... The more ardent
Luther's natural disposition was the more strongly he felt the
secret and unceasing resistance which human nature opposes to
goodness. This threw him into despair.</p>

<p>The monks and theologians of the day invited him to do works
in order to satisfy the Divine justice. But what works, thought
he, can proceed from such a heart as mine! How should I be able
with works polluted in their very principle, to stand in presence
of my holy Judge? "I felt myself," says he, "to be a great sinner
before God, and deemed it impossible to appease him by my
merits."</p>

<p>He was agitated, and, at the same time, gloomy, shunning the
silly and coarse conversation of the monks, who, unable to comprehend
the tempests of his soul, regarded him with astonishment,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
and reproached him for his gloom and taciturnity. It is told
by Cochl&oelig;us, that one day, when they were saying mass in
the chapel, Luther had come with his sighs, and stood amid the
friars in sadness and anguish. The priest had already prostrated
himself, the incense had been placed on the altar, the <i>Gloria</i> had
been chanted, and they were reading the Gospel, when the poor
monk, no longer able to contain his agony, exclaimed, in a piercing
tone, while throwing himself on his knees, "Not I! not I!"<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Every
one was in amazement, and the service was for a moment interrupted.
Perhaps Luther thought he had heard himself reproached
with something of which he knew he was innocent; perhaps he
meant to express his unworthiness to be one of those to whom the
death of Christ brought eternal life. Cochl&oelig;us says that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were reading the passage of Scripture which tells of the dumb
man out of whom Christ expelled a demon. If this account is
correct, Luther's cry might have a reference to this circumstance.
He might mean to intimate that though dumb like the man, it was
owing to another cause than the possession of a demon. In fact,
Cochl&oelig;us informs us that the friars sometimes attributed the agonies
of their brother to occult commerce with the devil,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and he
himself is of the same opinion.</p>

<p>A tender conscience led Luther to regard the smallest fault as
a great sin. No sooner had he discovered it than he strove to
expiate it by the severest mortifications. This, however, had no
other effect than to convince him of the utter inefficacy of all human
remedies. "I tormented myself to death," says he, "in
order to procure peace with God to my troubled heart and agitated
conscience; but, surrounded with fearful darkness, I nowhere
found it."</p>

<p>The acts of monastic holiness which lulled so many consciences,
and to which he himself had recourse in his agony, soon appeared
to Luther only the fallacious cures of an empirical and quack
religion. "At the time when I was a monk, if I felt some temptation
assail me, I am lost! said I to myself, and immediately
resorted to a thousand methods, in order to suppress the cries of
my heart. I confessed every day, but that did me no good. Thus
oppressed with sadness, I was tormented by a multiplicity of
thoughts. 'Look!' exclaimed I, 'there you are still envious, impatient,
passionate! It is of no use then, for you, O wretch, to
have entered this sacred order.'"</p>

<p>And yet Luther, imbued with the prejudices of his day, had
from his youth up considered the acts, whose impotence he now
experienced, as sure remedies for diseased souls. What was he
to think of the strange discovery which he had just made in the
solitude of the cloister? It is possible, then, to dwell in the sanctuary,
and still carry within oneself a man of sin! He has received
another garment, but not another heart. His hopes are disappointed.
Where is he to stop? Can it be that all these rules and
observances are only human inventions? Such a supposition appears
to him at one time a suggestion of the devil, and at another
time an irresistible truth. Struggling alternately with the holy
voice which spoke to his heart, and with venerable institutions
which had the sanction of ages, Luther's life was a continual combat.
The young monk, like a shade, glided through the long passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the cloister, making them echo with his sad groans.
His body pined away and his strength left him; on different occasions
he remained as if he were dead.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Once, overwhelmed with sadness, he shut himself up in his cell,
and for several days and nights allowed no one to approach him.
Lucas Edemberger, one of his friends, feeling uneasy about the
unhappy monk, and having some presentiment of the state in which
he actually was, taking with him several boys, who were accustomed
to chant in choirs, went and knocked at the door of his cell. No
one opens or answers. Good Edemberger, still more alarmed, forces
the door. Luther is stretched on the floor insensible, and showing
no signs of life. His friend tries in vain to revive him, but he still
remains motionless. The young boys begin to chant a soft anthem.
Their pure voices act like a charm on the poor monk, who had
always the greatest delight in music, and he gradually recovers
sensation, consciousness, and life.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> But if music could for some
moments give him a slight degree of serenity, another and more
powerful remedy was wanted to cure him effectually&mdash;that soft
and penetrating sound of the gospel, which is the voice of God
himself. He was well aware of this, and, accordingly, his sorrows
and alarms led him to study the writings of the apostles and prophets
with renewed zeal.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Luther was not the first monk who had passed through similar
struggles. The cloisters often shrouded within the obscurity of
their walls abominable vices, at which if they had been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to light, every honest mind would have shuddered; but they often
also concealed Christian virtues which were there unfolded in
silence, and which, if they had been placed before the eyes of the
world, would have excited admiration. These virtues, possessed
by those who lived only with themselves and with God, attracted
no attention, and were often even unknown to the modest convent
within which they were contained. Leading a life known to God
only, these humble solitaries fell occasionally into that mystical
theology, sad malady of noblest minds, which formerly constituted
the delight of the first monks on the banks of the Nile, and which
uselessly consumes those who fall under its influence.</p>

<p>Still, when one of these men happened to be called to an eminent
station, he there displayed virtues whose salutary influence
was long and widely felt. The candle being placed on the candlestick
gave light to all the house. Several were awakened by this
light, and hence those pious souls, propagated from generation to
generation, kept shining like solitary torches at the very time
when cloisters were often little better than impure receptacles of
the deepest darkness.</p>

<p>A young man had in this way attracted notice in one of the
convents of Germany. He was named John Staupitz, and was
of a noble family in Misnia. From his earliest youth, having
a taste for science and a love of virtue, he longed for retirement,
in order to devote himself to literature;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but soon finding that
philosophy and the study of nature could do little for eternal salvation,
he began to study theology, making it his special object to
join practice with knowledge. For, says one of his biographers,
it is vain to deck ourselves with the name of theologian, if we do
not prove our title to the honourable name by our life.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The
study of the Bible, and of the theology of St. Augustine, the knowledge
of himself, and the war which he, like Luther, had to wage
against the wiles and lusts of his heart, led him to the Redeemer,
through faith in whom he found peace to his soul. The doctrine
of the election of grace had, in particular, taken a firm hold of his
mind. Integrity of life, profound science and eloquence, combined
with a noble appearance and a dignified address, recommended
him to his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The Elector of Saxony, Frederick
the Wise, made him his friend, employed him on different embassies,
and under his direction founded the University of Wittemberg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
This disciple of St. Paul and St. Augustine was the first
Dean of the Faculty of Theology in that school which was one
day to send forth light to enlighten the schools and churches of so
many nations. He attended the council of Lateran, as deputy
from the Archbishop of Salzbourg, became provincial of his order
in Thuringia and Saxony, and ultimately vicar-general of the
Augustins all over Germany.</p>

<p>Staupitz lamented the corruption of manners and the errors in
doctrine which were laying waste the Church. This is proved by
his writings on the love of God, on Christian faith, on resemblance
to Christ in his death, and by the testimony of Luther. But he
considered the former of these evils as greatly the worse of the
two. Besides, the mildness and indecision of his character, and
his desire not to go beyond the sphere of action which he
thought assigned to him, made him fitter to be the restorer of a
convent than the Reformer of the Church. He could have wished
to confer important stations only on distinguished men, but not
finding them, he was contented to employ others. "We must
plough with horses," said he, "if we can find them; but if we have
no horses, we must plough with oxen."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>We have seen the anguish and inward wrestlings to which
Luther was a prey in the convent of Erfurt. At this time a visit
from the vicar-general was announced, and Staupitz accordingly
arrived to make his ordinary inspection. The friend of Frederick,
the founder of the University of Wittemberg, the head of the
Augustins, took a kind interest in the monks under his authority.
It was not long ere one of the friars of the convent attracted his
attention. This was a young man of middle stature, whom study,
abstinence, and vigils, had so wasted away, that his bones might
have been counted.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> His eyes, which at a later period were compared
to those of the falcon, were sunken, his gait was sad, and
his looks bespoke a troubled soul, the victim of numerous struggles,
yet still strong and bent on resisting. His whole appearance had
in it something grave, melancholy, and solemn. Staupitz, whose
discernment had been improved by long experience, easily discovered
what was passing in the soul of the young friar, and
singled him out from those around him. He felt drawn towards
him, had a presentiment of his high destiny, and experienced the
interest of a parent for his subaltern. He, too, had struggled
like Luther, and could therefore understand his situation. Above
all, he could show him the way of peace, which he himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
found. The information he received of the circumstances which
had brought the young Augustin to the convent increased his
sympathy. He requested the prior to treat him with great mildness,
and availed himself of the opportunities which his office gave
him to gain the young friar's confidence. Going kindly up to him,
he took every means to remove his timidity, which was moreover
increased by the respect and reverence which the elevated rank
of Staupitz naturally inspired.</p>

<p>The heart of Luther, till then closed by harsh treatment, opened
at last, and expanded to the mild rays of charity. "As in water
face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The heart
of Staupitz answered to the heart of Luther. The vicar-general
understood him; and the monk, in his turn, felt a confidence in
Staupitz which no one had hitherto inspired. He revealed to
him the cause of his sadness, depicted the fearful thoughts which
agitated him, and then in the cloister of Erfurt commenced a
conversation full of wisdom and instruction.</p>

<p>"In vain," said Luther despondingly to Staupitz; "in vain do I
make promises to God; sin has always the mastery."</p>

<p>"O my friend," replied the vicar-general, thinking how it had
been with himself, "more than a thousand times have I sworn to
our holy God to live piously, and I have never done so. Now
I no longer swear; for I know I should not perform. Unless God
be pleased to be gracious to me for the love of Christ, and to grant
me a happy departure when I leave this world, I shall not be able
with all my vows and all my good works to stand before him. I
must perish."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The young monk is terrified at the thought of the Divine
justice, and lays all his fears before the vicar-general. The ineffable
holiness of God, and his sovereign majesty, fill him with
alarm. Who will be able to support the day of his advent&mdash;who
to stand when he appeareth?</p>

<p>Staupitz resumes. He knows where he has found peace, and
his young friend will hear it. "Why torment thyself," said he to
him, "with all these speculations and high thoughts? Look to
the wounds of Jesus Christ, to the blood which he has shed for
thee; then thou shalt see the grace of God. Instead of making a
martyr of thyself for thy faults, throw thyself into the arms of the
Redeemer. Confide in him, in the righteousness of his life, and
the expiation of his death. Keep not back; God is not angry with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thee; it is thou who art angry with God. Listen to the Son of
God, who became man in order to assure thee of the Divine favour.
He says to thee, 'Thou art my sheep; thou hearest my
voice; none shall pluck thee out of my hand.'"<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>But Luther does not here find the repentance which he believes
necessary to salvation. He replies, and it is the ordinary reply of
agonised and frightened souls, "How dare I believe in the favour
of God, while there is nothing in me like true conversion? I must
be changed before he can receive me."</p>

<p>His venerable guide shows him that there can be no true conversion
while God is dreaded as a severe Judge. "What will you
say then," exclaims Luther, "of the many consciences, to which a
thousand unsupportable observances are prescribed as a means of
gaining heaven?"</p>

<p>Then he hears this reply from the vicar-general, or rather his
belief is, that it comes not from man, but is a voice sounding from
heaven.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> "No repentance," says Staupitz, "is true, save that
which begins with the love of God and of righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> What
others imagine to be the end and completion of repentance is, on
the contrary, only the commencement of it. To have a thorough
love of goodness, thou must, before all, have a thorough love of
God. If thou wouldest be converted, dwell not upon all these macerations
and tortures; 'Love him who first loved thee.'"</p>

<p>Luther listens and listens again. These consoling words fill
him with unknown joy, and give him new light. "It is Jesus
Christ," thinks he in his heart. "Yes, it is Jesus Christ himself
who consoles me so wonderfully by these sweet and salutary
words."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>These words, in fact, penetrated to the inmost heart of the
young monk, like the sharp arrow of a mighty man.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> In order to
repent, it is necessary to love God. Illumined with this new
light, he proceeds to examine the Scriptures, searching out all the
passages which speak of repentance and conversion. These
words, till now so much dreaded, become, to use his own expressions,
"an agreeable sport, and the most delightful recreation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
All the passages of Scripture which frightened him seem now
to rise up from all sides, smiling, and leaping, and sporting with
him."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>"Hitherto," exclaims he, "though I carefully disguised the
state of my heart, and strove to give utterance to a love which was
only constrained and fictitious, Scripture did not contain a word
which seemed to me more bitter than that of <i>repentance</i>. Now,
however, there is none sweeter and more agreeable.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Oh! how
pleasant the precepts of God are, when we read them not only in
books, but in the precious wounds of the Saviour."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Luther, though consoled by the words of Staupitz
was still subject to fits of depression. Sin manifested itself anew
to his timorous conscience, and then the joy of salvation was succeeded
by his former despair. "O my sin! my sin! my sin!"
one day exclaimed the young monk in presence of the vicar-general,
in accents of the deepest grief. "Ah!" replied he, "would
you only be a sinner on canvass, and also have a Saviour only
on canvass?" Then Staupitz gravely added, "Know that Jesus
Christ is the Saviour even of those who are great, real sinners,
and every way deserving of condemnation."</p>

<p>What agitated Luther was not merely the sin which he felt in
his heart. The upbraidings of his conscience were confirmed by
arguments drawn from reason. If the holy precepts of the Bible
frightened him, some of its doctrines likewise increased his terror.
Truth, which is the great means by which God gives peace to man,
must necessarily begin by removing the false security which destroys
him. The doctrine of election, in particular, disturbed the
young man, and threw him into a field which it is difficult to traverse.
Must he believe that it was man who, on his part, first
chose God? or that it was God who first chose man? The Bible,
history, daily experience, and the writings of Augustine, had shown
him that always, and in every thing, in looking for a first cause, it
was necessary to ascend to the sovereign will by which every thing
exists, and on which every thing depends. But his ardent spirit
would have gone farther. He would have penetrated into the
secret counsel of God, unveiled its mysteries, seen the invisible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and comprehended the incomprehensible. Staupitz interfered,
telling him not to pretend to fathom the hidden purposes of God,
but to confine himself to those of them which have been made manifest
in Christ. "Look to the wounds of Christ," said he to him,
"and there see a bright display of the purposes of God towards
man. It is impossible to comprehend God out of Jesus Christ.
In Christ you will find what I am, and what I require, saith the
Lord. You can find him nowhere else, either in heaven or on
the earth."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The vicar-general went farther. He convinced Luther of the
paternal designs of Providence, in permitting the various temptations
and combats which the soul has to sustain. He exhibited
them to him in a light well fitted to revive his courage. By such
trials God prepares those whom he destines for some important
work. The ship must be proved before it is launched on the
boundless deep. If this education is necessary for every man, it
is so particularly for those who are to have an influence on their
generation. This Staupitz represented to the monk of Erfurt;
"It is not without cause," said he to him, "that God exercises
you by so many combats; be assured he will employ you in great
things as his minister."</p>

<p>These words, which Luther hears with astonishment and humility,
fill him with courage, and give him a consciousness of
powers, whose existence he had not even suspected. The wisdom
and prudence of an enlightened friend gradually reveal the
strong man to himself. Nor does Staupitz rest here. He gives
him valuable directions as to his studies, exhorting him in future
to lay aside the systems of the school, and draw all his theology
from the Bible. "Let the study of the Scriptures," said he, "be
your favourite occupation." Never was good advice better followed.
But what, above all, delighted Luther, was the present
of a Bible from Staupitz. Perhaps it was the Latin Bible bound
in red leather, which belonged to the convent, and which it was
the summit of his desire to possess, that he might be able to carry
it about with him wherever he went, because all its leaves were
familiar to him, and he knew where to look for every passage.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> At
length this treasure is his own. From that time he studies the
Scriptures, and especially the Epistles of St. Paul, with always increasing
zeal. The only author whom he admits along with the
Bible is St. Augustine. Whatever he reads is deeply imprinted on
his soul, for his struggles had prepared him for comprehending it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The soil had been ploughed deep, and the incorruptible seed penetrates
far into it. When Staupitz left Erfurt, a new day had
dawned upon Luther.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the work was not finished. The vicar-general had
prepared it, but its completion was reserved for a humbler instrument.
The conscience of the young Augustin had not yet found
repose, and, owing to his efforts and the stretch on which his soul
had been kept, his body at length gave way. He was attacked
by an illness which brought him to the gates of death. This was
in the second year of his residence in the convent. All his
agonies and terrors were awakened at the approach of death.
His own pollution and the holiness of God anew distracted his
soul. One day, when overwhelmed with despair, an old monk
entered his cell, and addressed him in consoling terms. Luther
opened his heart to him, and made him aware of the fears by
which he was agitated. The respectable old man was incapable
of following him into all his doubts as Staupitz had done; but he
knew his <i>Credo</i>, and having found in it the means of consoling
his own heart, he could apply the same remedy to the young friar.
Leading him back to the Apostles' Creed, which Luther had
learned in infancy at the school of Mansfield, the old monk good-naturedly
repeated the article, "<i>I believe in the forgiveness of
sins</i>." These simple words, which the pious friar calmly repeated
at this decisive moment, poured great consolation into the soul of
Luther. "I believe," oft repeated he to himself on his sick-bed,
"I believe in the forgiveness of sins." "Ah!" said the monk,
"the thing to be believed is not merely that David's or Peter's
sins are forgiven; this the devils believe: God's command is,
to believe that our own sins are forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> How delightful this
command appeared to poor Luther! "See what St. Bernard says
in his sermon on the annunciation," added the old friar; "the witness
which the Holy Spirit witnesseth with our spirit is, 'Thy sins
are forgiven thee.'"</p>

<p>From this moment light sprung up in the heart of the young
monk of Erfurt. The gracious word has been pronounced, and
he believes it. He renounces the idea of meriting salvation,
and puts implicit confidence in the grace of God through Jesus
Christ. He does not see all the consequences of the principle
which he has admitted; he is still sincere in his attachment to the
Church, and yet he has no longer need of her. He has received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
salvation immediately from God himself; and from that moment
Roman Catholicism is virtually destroyed in him. He goes forward
and searches the writings of the apostles and prophets, for
every thing that may strengthen the hope which fills his heart.
Each day he invokes help from above, and each day also the light
increases in his soul.</p>

<p>The health which his spirit had found soon restores health to his
body, and he rises from his sick-bed, after having, in a double
sense, received a new life. During the feast of Noel, which arrived
shortly after, he tasted abundantly of all the consolations of faith.
With sweet emotion he took part in the holy solemnities, and
when in the middle of the gorgeous service of the day, he came to
chant these words:&mdash;"<i>O beata culpa, quæ talem meruisti Redemptorem!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
his whole being said <i>Amen</i>, and thrilled with joy.</p>

<p>Luther had been two years in the cloister, and must now be
consecrated priest. He had received much, and he looked forward
with delight to the prospect which the priesthood presented
of enabling him freely to give what he had freely received.
Wishing to avail himself of the occasion to be fully reconciled to
his father, he invited him to be present, and even asked him to
fix the day. John Luther, though not yet entirely appeased,
nevertheless accepted the invitation, and named Sabbath the 2nd
May, 1507.</p>

<p>In the list of Luther's friends was the vicar of Isenach, John
Braun, who had been his faithful adviser when he resided in that
town. Luther wrote him on the 22nd April. It is the Reformer's
earliest letter, and bears the following address:&mdash;"To John
Braun, Holy and Venerable Priest of Christ and Mary." It is
only in the two first letters of Luther that the name of Mary
occurs.</p>

<p>"God, who is glorious and holy in all his works," says the candidate
for the priesthood, "having designed to exalt me exceedingly,&mdash;me,
a miserable and every way unworthy sinner, and to
call me solely out of his abundant mercy, to his sublime ministry,
it is my duty in order to testify my gratitude for a goodness so
divine and so magnificent, (as far at least as dust can do it,) to
fulfil with my whole heart the office which is entrusted to me."</p>

<p>At length the day arrived. The miner of Mansfield failed not
to be present at the consecration of his son.... He even gave
him an unequivocal mark of his affection and generosity, by making
him a present of twenty florins on the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>The ceremony took place, Jerome, Bishop of Brandebourg,
officiating. At the moment of conferring on Luther the right to
celebrate mass, he put the chalice into his hand, uttering these
solemn words, "<i>Accipe potestatem sacrificandi pro vivis et mortuis</i>"&mdash;"Receive
power to sacrifice for the living and the dead."
Luther then listened complacently to these words, which gave
him the power of doing the very work appropriated to the Son of
God; but they afterwards made him shudder. "That the earth
did not swallow us both," said he, "was more than we deserved,
and was owing to the great patience and long-suffering of the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The father afterwards dined at the convent with his son, the
friends of the young priest and the monks. The conversation
turned on Martin's entrance into the cloister, the friars loudly
extolling it as one of the most meritorious of works. Then the
inflexible John, turning towards his son, said to him, "Hast thou
not read in Scripture to obey thy father and thy mother?"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> These
words struck Luther; they gave him quite a different view of the
action which had brought him into the convent, and for a long
time continued to echo in his heart.</p>

<p>By the advice of Staupitz, Luther, shortly after his ordination,
made short excursions on foot into the neighbouring parishes and
convents, both for relaxation, to give his body the necessary exercise,
and to accustom himself to preaching.</p>

<p>The Fête Dieu was to be celebrated with splendour at Eisleben,
where the vicar-general was to be present. Luther repaired
thither. He had still need of Staupitz, and missed no opportunity
of meeting with this enlightened conductor who was guiding him
into the way of life. The procession was numerous and brilliant.
Staupitz himself carried the holy sacrament, and Luther followed
in his sacerdotal dress. The thought that it was truly Jesus
Christ that the vicar-general was carrying&mdash;the idea that Christ
was there in person actually before him&mdash;suddenly struck Luther's
imagination, and filled him with such amazement that he could
scarcely move forward. The perspiration fell from him in drops;
he shook, and thought he would have died with agony and terror.
At length the procession ceased. This host which had so awakened
the fears of the monk was solemnly deposited in the sanctuary,
and Luther, as soon as he was alone with Staupitz, threw
himself into his arms, and told him of his consternation. Then
the worthy vicar-general, who had long known that Saviour who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
breaketh not the bruised reed, said to him mildly, "It was not
Jesus Christ, my brother. Jesus Christ does not alarm&mdash;he consoles
merely."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Luther was not to remain hid in an obscure convent. The
time had arrived for his being transported to a larger theatre.
Staupitz, with whom he was in constant correspondence, was well
aware that the soul of the young monk was too active to be confined
within so narrow a circle. He mentioned him to Frederick
of Saxony, and this enlightened prince, in 1508, probably towards
the close of the year, invited him to a chair in the university of
Wittemberg. Wittemberg was a field on which he was to fight
hard battles; and Luther felt that his vocation was there. Being
required to repair promptly to his new post, he answered the appeal
without delay; and, in the hurry of his removal, had not
even time to write him whom he called his master and beloved
father&mdash;John Braun, curate of Isenach. Some months after, he
wrote&mdash;"My departure was so sudden, that those I was living
with scarcely knew of it. I am far away, I confess: but the
better part of me is still with you."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Luther had been three
years in the cloister of Erfurt.</p>

<h2>CHAP. V</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The University of Wittemberg&mdash;First Employment&mdash;Biblical Lectures&mdash;Sensation&mdash;Preaching
at Wittemberg&mdash;The Old Chapel&mdash;Impression.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the year 1502, the Elector Frederick had founded a new university
at Wittemberg, declaring, in the act by which he confirmed
it, that he and his people would turn to it as towards an
oracle. He thought not at the time that these words would be
so magnificently realised. Two men belonging to the opposition
which had been formed against the scholastic system, viz., Pollich
of Mellerstadt, doctor of medicine, law, and philosophy, and
Staupitz, had great influence in founding this school. The university
declared St. Augustine its patron; and even this choice was
a presage of good. In possession of great freedom, and regarded
as a tribunal to which, in cases of difficulty, the supreme decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
belonged, this new institution, which was in every way fitted to
become the cradle of the Reformation, powerfully contributed to
the development of Luther and his work.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Wittemberg, Luther repaired to the convent
of Augustins, where a cell was alloted him; for though professor,
he ceased not to be monk. He was appointed to teach
philosophy and dialectics. In assigning him these departments,
regard had, no doubt, been had to the studies which he had prosecuted
at Erfurt, and to his degree of Master of Arts. Thus
Luther, who was hungering and thirsting for the word of life,
saw himself obliged to give his almost exclusive attention to the
scholastic philosophy of Aristotle. He had need of the bread of
life which God gives to the world, and he must occupy himself
with human subtleties. How galling! How much he sighed!
"I am well, by the grace of God," wrote he to Braun, "were it
not that I must study philosophy with all my might. Ever since
I arrived at Wittemberg, I have eagerly desired to exchange this
study for that of theology: but," added he, lest it should be
thought he meant the theology of the time, "the theology I mean
is that which seeks out the kernel of the nut, the heart of the
wheat, and the marrow of the bone.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Howbeit God is God," continues
he, with that confidence which was the soul of his life,
"man is almost always deceived in his judgment; but he is our
God, and will conduct us by his goodness for ever and ever."
The studies in which Luther was at this time obliged to engage
were afterwards of great service to him in combating the errors
of the schoolmen.</p>

<p>Here, however, he could not stop. The desire of his heart
must be accomplished. The same power which formerly pushed
him from the bar into the monastic life now pushed him from
philosophy towards the Bible. He zealously commenced the
study of ancient languages, especially Greek and Hebrew, that he
might be able to draw science and learning at the fountain-head.
He was all his life an indefatigable student.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Some months after
his arrival at the university he applied for the degree of Bachelor
in Divinity, and obtained it in the end of March 1509, with a
special injunction to devote himself to biblical theology, <i>ad Biblia</i>.</p>

<p>Every day at one, Luther had to lecture on the Bible,&mdash;a precious
employment both for the professor and his pupils&mdash;giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
them a better insight into the divine meaning of those oracles
which had so long been lost both to the people and the school.</p>

<p>He began his lectures with an exposition of the Psalms, and
shortly after proceeded to the Epistle to the Romans. It was
especially when meditating upon it that the light of truth entered
his heart. After retiring to his quiet cell he spent hours in the
study of the Divine Word&mdash;the Epistle of St. Paul lying open before
him. One day, coming to the seventeenth verse of the first
chapter, he read these words of the prophet Habakkuk, "<i>The
just shall live by faith</i>." He is struck with the expression. The
just, then, has a different life from other men, and this life is
given by faith. These words, which he receives into his heart as
if God himself had there deposited them, unveils the mystery of
the Christian life to him, and gives him an increase of this life.
Long after, in the midst of his numerous labours, he thought he
still heard a voice saying to him, "The just shall live by faith."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Luther's lectures, thus prepared, had little resemblance to those
which had hitherto been delivered. It was not a declamatory
rhetorician, or a pedantic schoolman that spoke; it was a Christian
who had felt the power of revealed truth&mdash;truth which he derived
from the Bible, and presented to his astonished hearers, all full
of life, as it came from the treasury of his heart. It was not a
lesson from man, but a lesson from God.</p>

<p>This novel exposition of the truth was much talked of. The news
spread far and wide, and attracted a great number of foreign students
to the recently founded university. Even some of the professors
attended the lectures of Luther, among others, Mellerstadt, often
surnamed, "<i>The Light of the World</i>." He was the first rector of
the university, and had previously been at Leipsic, where he had
vigorously combated the ridiculous lessons of the schoolmen, and
denying that "the light of the first day of creation could be theology,"
had maintained that this science ought to be based on the
study of literature. "This monk," said he, "will send all the doctors
to the right about. He will introduce a new doctrine, and
reform the whole Church, for he founds upon the word of God;
and no man in the world can either combat or overthrow this word,
even though he should attack it with all the weapons of philosophy,
the sophists, Scotists, Albertists, Thomists, and the whole fraternity."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Staupitz, who was the instrument in the hand of Providence to
unfold the gifts and treasures hidden in Luther, invited him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
preach in this church of the Augustins. The young professor recoiled
at this proposal. He wished to confine himself to his academic
functions, and trembled at the thought of adding to them
that of preacher. In vain did Staupitz urge him. "No, no,"
replied he, "it is no light matter to speak to men in the place of
God."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Touching humility in this great Reformer of the Church!
Staupitz insisted; but the ingenious Luther, says one of his
biographers, found fifteen arguments, pretexts, and evasions, to
excuse himself from this calling. The chief of the Augustins, still
continuing his attack, Luther exclaimed, "Ah! doctor, in doing
this, you deprive me of life. I would not be able to hold out
three months." "Very well," replied the vicar-general, "so be
it in God's name. For up yonder, also, our Lord has need of able
and devoted men." Luther behoved to yield.</p>

<p>In the middle of the public square of Wittemberg was a
wooden chapel, thirty feet long by twenty wide, whose sides,
propped up in all directions, were falling to decay. An old pulpit
made of fir, three feet in height, received the preacher. In this
miserable chapel the preaching of the Reformation commenced.
God was pleased that that which was to establish his glory should
have the humblest origin. The foundation of the church of the
Augustins had just been laid, and until it should be finished
this humble church was employed. "This building," adds the
contemporary of Luther who relates these circumstances, "may
well be compared to the stable in which Christ was born. It was
in this miserable inclosure that God was pleased, so to speak, to
make his beloved Son be born a second time. Among the thousands
of cathedrals and parish churches with which the world
abounded, there was then one only which God selected for the
glorious preaching of eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Luther preaches, and every thing is striking in the new preacher.
His expressive countenance, his noble air, his clear and sonorous
voice, captivate the hearers.</p>

<p>The greater part of preachers before him had sought rather to
amuse their auditory than to convert them. The great seriousness
which predominates in Luther's preaching, and the joy with
which the knowledge of the gospel has filled his heart, give to his
eloquence at once an authority, a fervour, and an unction which
none of his predecessors had. "Endowed," says one of his opponents,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
"with a keen and acute intellect, and a retentive memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and having an admirable facility in the use of his mother tongue,
Luther, in point of eloquence, yielded to none of his age. Discoursing
from the pulpit as if he had been agitated by some
strong passion, and suiting his action to his words, he produced a
wonderful impression on the minds of his hearers, and like a torrent,
carried them along whithersoever he wished. So much force,
gracefulness, and eloquence, are seldom seen in the people of the
north." "He had," says Bossuet, "a lively and impetuous eloquence,
which hurried people away and entranced them."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In a short time the little chapel could not contain the hearers
who crowded to it. The council of Wittemberg then made
choice of Luther for their preacher, and appointed him to preach
in the town church. The impression which he produced here was
still greater. The power of his genius, the eloquence of his diction,
and the excellence of the doctrines which he announced,
equally astonished his hearers. His reputation spread far and
wide, and Frederick the Wise himself once came to Wittemberg
to hear him.</p>

<p>Luther had commenced a new life. The uselessness of the
cloister had been succeeded by great activity. The liberty, the
labour, the constant activity to which he could devote himself at
Wittemberg, completely restored his internal harmony and peace.
He was now in his place, and the work of God was soon to exhibit
its majestic step.</p>

<p>Luther was teaching both in his academic chair and in the
church, when his labours were interrupted. In 1510, or, according
to some, not till 1511 or 1512, he was sent to Rome. Seven
convents of his order having differed on certain points with the
vicar-general,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> the activity of Luther's mind, the power of his
eloquence, and his talent for discussion, made him be selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to plead the cause of these seven monasteries before the pope.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
This Divine dispensation was necessary to Luther, for it was requisite
that he should know Rome. Full of the prejudices and
illusions of the cloister, he had always represented it to himself as
the seat of holiness.</p>

<p>He accordingly set out and crossed the Alps, but scarcely had
he descended into the plains of rich and voluptuous Italy, than he
found at every step subjects of astonishment and scandal. The
poor German monk was received in a rich convent of Benedictines,
situated upon the Pô in Lombardy. This convent had
thirty-six thousand ducats of revenue. Of these, twelve thousand
were devoted to the table, twelve thousand to the buildings, and
twelve thousand to the other wants of the monks.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The gorgeousness
of the apartments, the beauty of the dresses, and the
rarities of the table, all astonished Luther. Marble and silk, and
luxury under all its forms! How new the sight to the humble
friar of the poor convent of Wittemberg! He was astonished and
said nothing, but when Friday came, how surprised was he to see
abundance of meat still covering the table of the Benedictines!
Then he resolved to speak out. "The Church and the pope," said
he to them, "forbid such things." The Benedictines were indignant
at this reprimand from the rude German, but Luther having
insisted, and perhaps threatened to make their disorders known,
some of them thought that the simplest plan was to get rid of
their troublesome guest. The porter of the convent having
warned him that he ran a risk in staying longer, he made his
escape from this epicurean monastery, and arrived at Bologna,
where he fell dangerously sick.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Some have seen in this sickness
the effects of poison, but it is simpler to suppose that it was the
effect which a change of living produced in the frugal monk of
Wittemberg, whose principal food was wont to be bread and herrings.
This sickness was not to be unto death, but for the glory of
God. Luther's constitutional sadness and depression again overpowered
him. To die thus far from Germany, under this burning
sky in a foreign land, what a fate! The agonies which he had
felt at Erfurt returned with all their force. The conviction of his
sins troubled, while the prospect of the judgment-seat of God
terrified him. But at the moment when these terrors were at
the worst, the passage of St. Paul which had struck him at
Wittemberg, "The just shall live by faith," (Rom., i, 17,) presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
itself to his mind, and illumined his soul as with a ray of
light from heaven. Revived and comforted, he soon recovered his
health, and resumed his journey to Rome, expecting he should
there find quite a different life from that of the Lombard convents,
and impatient by the sight of Roman holiness to efface the
sad impressions which had been left upon his mind by his residence
on the Pô.</p>

<p>At length, after a painful journey under the burning sky of
Italy in the beginning of summer, he drew near to the city of the
seven hills. His heart was moved, and his eyes looked for the
queen of the world, and of the Church. As soon as he obtained a
distant view of the eternal city, the city of St. Peter and St. Paul,
and the metropolis of Catholicism, he threw himself on the ground,
exclaiming, "Holy Rome, I salute thee."</p>

<p>Luther is in Rome; the professor of Wittemberg is in the
midst of the eloquent ruins of the Rome of the consuls and emperors&mdash;the
Rome of the confessors and martyrs. Here lived that
Plautus and Virgil, whose works he had taken with him into the
cloister, and all those great men whose exploits had always caused
his heart to beat. He perceives their statues, and the wrecks of
monuments which attest their glory. But all this glory and all
this power are past, and his foot treads on their dust. At every
step he calls to mind the sad forebodings of Scipio shedding tears at
the sight of Carthage in ruins, its burned palaces and broken walls,
and exclaiming, "Thus, too, will it be with Rome!" "And in
fact," says Luther, "the Rome of the Scipios and Cæsars has been
changed into a corpse. Such is the quantity of ruins, that the
foundations of the modern houses rest upon the roofs of the old.
"There," added he, casting a melancholy look on the ruins, "there
were the riches and treasures of the world."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> All this rubbish,
which he strikes with his foot, tells Luther, within the walls of
Rome herself, that what is strongest in the eyes of men is easily
destroyed by the breath of the Lord.</p>

<p>But he remembers that with profane ashes holy ashes are
mingled. The burial-place of the martyrs is not far from that of
the generals and triumphing heroes of Rome, and Christian Rome,
with her sufferings, has more power over the heart of the Saxon
monk than Pagan Rome with her glory. It was here the letter
arrived in which Paul wrote, "<i>The just is justified by faith</i>," and
not far off is the Appii Forum and the Three Taverns. There was
the house of Narcissus&mdash;here the palace of Cæsar, where the Lord
delivered the apostle from the mouth of the lion. Oh, what fortitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
these recollections give to the heart of the monk of Wittemberg!</p>

<p>Rome then presented a very different aspect. The pontifical
chair was occupied by the warlike Julius II, and not by Leo
X, as it has been said by some distinguished historians of Germany,
no doubt through oversight. Luther often told an anecdote
of this pope. When news was brought him of the defeat of his
army by the French before Ravenna, he was reading his Hours.
He dashed the book upon the ground, and said, with a dreadful
oath, "Very well, so you have turned Frenchman. Is this the
way in which you protect your Church?" Then turning in the
direction of the country to whose aid he meant to have recourse,
he exclaimed, "Holy Switzer, pray for us."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Ignorance, levity,
and dissoluteness, a profane spirit, a contempt of all that is sacred,
and a shameful traffic in divine things; such was the spectacle
which that unhappy city presented, and yet the pious monk continued
for some time in his illusions.</p>

<p>Having arrived about the feast of St. John, he hears the Romans
about him repeating a proverb which was then common among
the people: "Happy," said they, "is the mother whose son says
a mass on the eve of St. John." "Oh! how I could like to make
my mother happy!" said Luther. The pious son of Margaret
accordingly sought to say a mass on that day, but could not; the
press was too great.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Ardent and simple-hearted, he went up and down, visiting all
the churches and chapels, believing all the lies that were told him,
and devoutly performing the requisite acts of holiness; happy in
being able to do so many pious works, which were denied to his
countrymen. "Oh! how much I regret," said the pious German
to himself, "that my father and mother are still alive. What
delight I should have had in delivering them from the fire of purgatory,
by my masses, my prayers, and many other admirable
works."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> He had found the light, but the darkness was still far
from being entirely banished from his understanding. His heart
was changed, but his mind was not fully enlightened. He possessed
faith and love, but not knowledge. It was work of no small
difficulty to escape from the dark night which had for so many
ages covered the earth.</p>

<p>Luther repeatedly said mass at Rome, taking care to do it with
all the unction and dignity which the service seemed to him to
require. But how grieved was the heart of the Saxon monk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at seeing the profane formality of the Roman priests in celebrating
the sacrament of the altar. The priests, on their part,
laughed at his simplicity. One day when he was officiating, he
found that at the altar next to him seven masses had been read
before he got through a single one. "Get on, get on," cried one
of the priests to him; "make haste, and send Our Lady back her
Son," making an impious allusion to the transubstantiation of the
bread into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. On another
occasion, Luther had only got as far as the Gospel, when the priest
beside him had finished the whole mass. "On, on," said his
companion; "make haste, make haste; are ye ever to have done?"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>His astonishment was still greater when, in the dignitaries of
the Church, he discovered the same thing that he had found in
common priests. He had hoped better of them.</p>

<p>It was fashionable at the papal court to attack Christianity, and,
in order to pass for a complete gentleman, absolutely necessary to
hold some erroneous or heretical opinion on the doctrines of the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> When Erasmus was at Rome, they had attempted to
prove to him, by passages from Pliny, that there was no difference
between the soul of man and that of the brutes;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and young
courtiers of the pope maintained that the orthodox faith was
merely the result of crafty inventions by some saints.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Luther's employment, as envoy of the Augustins of Germany,
caused him to be invited to several meetings of distinguished
ecclesiastics. One day, in particular, he happened to be at table
with several prelates, who frankly exhibited themselves to him
in their mountebank manners and profane conversation, and
did not scruple to commit a thousand follies in his presence, no
doubt believing him to be of the same spirit as themselves.
Among other things they related, in presence of the monk, laughing
and making a boast of it, how when they were saying mass,
instead of the sacramental words, which should transform the
bread and wine into the Saviour's flesh and blood, they parodied
them, and said, "<i>Panis es, et panis manebis; vinum es, et vinum manebis</i>:"
Bread thou art, and bread wilt remain; wine thou art, and
wine wilt remain. Then, continued they, we raise the <i>ostensorium</i>,
and all the people worship it. Luther could scarcely believe his
ears. His spirit, which was lively and even gay in the society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
his friends, was all gravity when sacred things were in question.
He was scandalised at the profane pleasantries of Rome. "I was,"
said be, "a young monk, grave and pious, and these words distressed
me greatly. If they speak thus in Rome at table, freely and
publicly, thought I to myself, what will it be if their actions correspond
to their words, and if all, pope, cardinals, courtiers, say
mass in the same style? And I, who have devoutly heard so large
a number read, how must I have been deceived!"<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Luther often mingled with the monks and the citizens of Rome.
If some extolled the pope and his court, the great majority gave
free utterance to their complaints and their sarcasms. What
tales they told of the reigning pope, of Alexander VI, and of
many others! One day his Roman friends told him how Cæsar
Borgia, after having fled from Rome, was apprehended in Spain.
When they were going to try him he pleaded guilty in prison,
and requested a confessor. A monk having been sent, he slew
him, and, wrapping himself up in his cloak, made his escape.
"I heard that at Rome, and it is quite certain,"<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> said Luther.
One day passing through a public street which led to St. Peter's,
he stopped in amazement before a statue, representing a pope
under the form of a woman holding a sceptre, clad in the papal
mantle, and carrying an infant in her arms. It is a girl of Mentz,
said they to him, whom the cardinals chose for pope, and who
had a child at this spot. Hence no pope ever passes through this
street. "I am astonished," said Luther, "how the popes allow
the statue to remain."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Luther had expected to find the edifice of the church in strength
and splendour, but its gates were forced, and its walls consumed
with fire. He saw the desolations of the sanctuary, and started
back in dismay. He had dreamed of nothing but holiness, and he
discovered nothing but profanation.</p>

<p>He was not less struck with the disorders outside the churches.
"The Roman police," says he, "is strict and severe. The judge
or captain every night makes a round of the town on horseback,
with three hundred attendants, and arrests every person he finds
in the streets. If he meets any one armed he hangs him up, or
throws him into the Tiber; and yet the city is full of disorder and
murder, whereas, when the word of God is purely and rightly
taught, peace and order are seen to reign, and there is no need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of law and its severities."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> "It is almost incredible what sins and
infamous actions are committed at Rome," says he, on another
occasion; "one would require to see it and hear it in order to believe
it. Hence, it is an ordinary saying, that if there is a hell,
Rome is built upon it. It is an abyss from whence all sins proceed."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>This sight made a strong impression on Luther's mind at the
time, and the impression was deepened at a later period. "The
nearer we approach Rome the more bad Christians we find," said
he several years after. "There is a common saying, that he who
goes to Rome, the first time seeks a rogue, the second time finds
him, and the third time brings him away with him in his own
person; but now people are become so skilful, that they make
all the three journeys in one." A genius, one of the most unhappily
celebrated, but also one of the most profound of Italy, Machiavelli,
who was living at Florence when Luther passed through it
on his way to Rome, has made the same remark: "The strongest
symptom," says he, "of the approaching ruin of Christianity, (he
means Roman Catholicism,) is, that the nearer you come to the
capital of Christendom the less you find of the Christian spirit.
The scandalous examples and crimes of the court of Rome are
the cause why Italy has lost every principle of piety and all religious
sentiment. We Italians," continues the great historian,
"are chiefly indebted to the Church and the priests for our
having become a set of profane scoundrels."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> At a later period
Luther was fully aware how much he had gained by his journey
"I would not take a hundred thousand florins," said he, "not to
have seen Rome."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The journey was also of the greatest advantage to him in a literary
view. Like Reuchlin, Luther availed himself of his residence
in Italy to penetrate farther into the knowledge of the
Holy Scriptures. He took lessons in Hebrew from a celebrated
rabbi named Elias Levita; and thus, at Rome, partly acquired
the knowledge of that Divine word under whose blows Rome
was destined to fall.</p>

<p>But there was another respect in which the journey was of
great importance to Luther. Not only was the veil torn away
and the sardonic smile, and mountebank infidelity which lurked
behind the Roman superstitions, revealed to the future Reformer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but, moreover, the living faith which God had implanted in him
was powerfully strengthened.</p>

<p>We have seen how he at first entered devotedly into all the
vain observances, to which, as a price, the Church has annexed
the expiation of sins. One day, among others, wishing to gain
an indulgence which the pope had promised to every one who
should on his knees climb up what is called Pilate's Stair, the
Saxon monk was humbly crawling up the steps, which he was told
had been miraculously transported to Rome from Jerusalem.
But while he was engaged in this meritorious act, he thought he
heard a voice of thunder which cried at the bottom of his heart,
as at Wittemberg and Bologna, "<i>The just shall live by faith.</i>"
These words, which had already on two different occasions struck
him like the voice of an angel of God, resounded loudly and incessantly
within him. He rises up in amazement from the steps
along which he was dragging his body. Horrified at himself, and
ashamed to see how far superstition has abased him, he flies far
from the scene of his folly.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>In regard to this mighty word there is something mysterious in
the life of Luther. It proved a creating word both for the Reformer
and for the Reformation. It was by it that God then said,
"Let light be, and light was."</p>

<p>It is often necessary that a truth, in order to produce its due
effect on the mind, must be repeatedly presented to it. Luther
had carefully studied the Epistle to the Romans, and yet,
though justification by faith is there taught, he had never seen it so
clearly. Now he comprehends the righteousness which alone
can stand in the presence of God; now he receives from God
himself, by the hand of Christ, that obedience which he freely
imputes to the sinner as soon as he humbly turns his eye to the
God-Man who was crucified. This is the decisive period in the
internal life of Luther. The faith which has saved him from the
terrors of death becomes the soul of his theology, his fortress in
all dangers, the stamina of his discourse, the stimulant of his love,
the foundation of his peace, the spur of his labours, his consolation
in life and in death.</p>

<p>But this great doctrine of a salvation which emanates from God
and not from man, was not only the power of God to save the
soul of Luther, it also became the power of God to reform the
Church; a powerful weapon which the apostles wielded, a weapon
too long neglected, but at length brought forth in its primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
lustre from the arsenal of the mighty God. At the moment when
Luther stood up in Rome, all moved and thrilling with the words
which Paul had addressed fifteen centuries before to the inhabitants
of this metropolis, truth, till then a fettered captive within
the Church, rose up also, never again to fall.</p>

<p>Here we must let Luther speak for himself. "Although I was a
holy and irreproachable monk, my conscience was full of trouble and
anguish. I could not bear the words, 'Justice of God.' I loved not
the just and holy God who punishes sinners. I was filled with
secret rage against him and hated him, because, not satisfied with
terrifying us, his miserable creatures, already lost by original sin,
with his law and the miseries of life, he still further increased our
torment by the gospel.... But when, by the Spirit of God, I
comprehended these words; when I learned how the sinner's justification
proceeds from the pure mercy of the Lord by means of
faith,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> then I felt myself revive like a new man, and entered at
open doors into the very paradise of God.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> From that time, also,
I beheld the precious sacred volume with new eyes. I went over
all the Bible, and collected a great number of passages which taught
me what the work of God was. And as I had previously, with
all my heart, hated the words, 'Justice of God,' so from that
time I began to esteem and love them, as words most sweet and
most consoling. In truth, these words were to me the true gate
of paradise."</p>

<p>Accordingly, when called on solemn occasions to confess this
doctrine, Luther always manifested his enthusiasm and rude energy.
"I see," said he on a critical occasion, "that the devil is
incessantly attacking this fundamental article<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> by the instrumentality
of his doctors, and that, in this respect, he cannot rest or
take any repose. Very well, I, Doctor Martin Luther, unworthy
evangelist of our Lord Jesus Christ, hold this article&mdash;<i>that faith
alone, without works, justifies in the sight of God</i>; and I declare that
the emperor of the Romans, the emperor of the Turks, the emperor
of the Tartars, the emperor of the Persians, the pope, all
the cardinals, bishops, priests, monks, nuns, princes, and nobles,
all men and all devils, must let it stand, and allow it to remain
for ever. If they will undertake to combat this truth, they will
bring down the flames of hell upon their heads. This is the true
and holy gospel, and the declaration of me, Doctor Luther, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to the light of the Holy Spirit.... Nobody," continues
he, "has died for our sins but Jesus Christ the Son of God. I
repeat it once more; should the world and all the devils tear each
other, and burst with fury, this is, nevertheless, true. And if it
be He alone who takes away sin, it cannot be ourselves with our
works; but good works follow redemption, as the fruit appears
on the tree. This is our doctrine; and it is the doctrine which the
Holy Spirit teaches with all true Christians. We maintain it in
the name of God. Amen."</p>

<p>It was thus Luther found what all doctors and reformers, even
the most distinguished, had, to a certain degree at least, failed
to discover. It was in Rome that God gave him this clear view
of the fundamental doctrine of Christianity. He had come to the
city of the pontiffs seeking the solution of some difficulties relative
to a monastic order, and he carried away in his heart the safety
of the Church.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Return&mdash;Doctor's Degree&mdash;Carlstadt&mdash;Luther's Oath&mdash;Principle of Reform&mdash;Luther's
Courage&mdash;First Views of Reformation&mdash;The Schoolmen&mdash;Spalatin&mdash;Affair
of Reuchlin.</p></blockquote>


<p>Luther quitted Rome and returned to Wittemberg, his heart
full of sadness and indignation. Turning away his eyes in disgust
from the pontifical city, he directed them in hope to the Holy
Scriptures, and to that new light of which the word of God
seemed then to give promise to the world. This word gained in
his heart all that the Church lost in it. He detached himself
from the one and turned towards the other. The whole Reformation
was in that movement. It put God where the priest had
hitherto been.</p>

<p>Staupitz and the elector did not lose sight of the monk whom
they had called to the university of Wittemberg. It would seem
that the vicar-general had a presentiment of the work that was to
be done in the world, and, feeling it too much for himself, wished
to urge on Luther. There is nothing more remarkable, and perhaps
more mysterious, than this personage, who is ever found
hurrying on the monk into the path to which God calls him; and
who himself ultimately goes and sadly ends his days in a convent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The preaching of the young professor had made an impression
on the prince. He had admired the vigour of his intellect, the
nervousness of his eloquence, and the excellence of his expositions.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
The elector and his friend, wishing to advance a man who
gave such high hopes, resolved to make him take the honourable
degree of Doctor of Divinity. Staupitz repairing to the convent,
led Luther into the garden, and there alone with him, under a
tree which Luther was afterwards fond of showing to his disciples,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
the venerable father said to him&mdash;" It is now necessary,
my friend, that you become a doctor of the Holy Scriptures."
Luther recoiled at the idea; the high honour frightened him.
"Look out," replied he, "for a more worthy person; as for me,
I cannot consent to it." The vicar-general insisted, "The Lord
God has much to do in the Church, and has need at present of
young and vigorous doctors." These words, adds Melancthon,
were perhaps used half in jest, and yet the event realised them.
Many omens ordinarily precede great revolutions.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It is not
necessary to suppose that Melancthon here speaks of miraculous
predictions. The most incredulous age&mdash;that which preceded our
own&mdash;saw this sentiment verified. There was no miracle; and
yet how many presages announced the revolution with which it
closed?</p>

<p>"But I am weak and sickly," replied Luther, "and have not
long to live. Seek a strong man." "The Lord," replied the
vicar-general, "has work in heaven as well as on the earth; dead
or alive, God has need of you in his counsel."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>"None but the Holy Spirit can make a doctor of theology,"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
exclaimed the monk, still more alarmed. "Do what your convent
asks," said Staupitz, "and what I, your vicar-general, command.
You promised to obey us." "But my poverty," replied
the friar. "I have no means of paying the expences attendant on
such promotion." "Give yourself no trouble about them," said
his friend. "The prince has been graciously pleased to take all the
expences on himself." Luther, thus urged, saw it his duty to
yield.</p>

<p>This was towards the end of the summer of 1512. Luther set
out for Leipsic to receive the money necessary for his promotion
from the elector's treasures. But according to the usages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
courts, the money came not. The friar getting impatient would
have left, but monastic obedience detained him. At length, on the
4th of October, he received fifty florins from Pfeffinger and John
Doltzig, and gave them his receipt for it, in which he designates
himself merely as a monk. "I, Martin," says he, "friar of the
order of Eremites."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Luther hastened back to Wittemberg.</p>

<p>Andrew Bodenstein was then Dean of the Faculty of Theology,
and is best known under the name of Carlstadt, being that of his
native town. He was also called A. B. C. It was Melancthon
who first gave him this designation, which is taken from the three
initial letters of his name. Bodenstein acquired the first elements
of literature in his native place. He was of a grave and gloomy
temper, perhaps inclined to jealousy, and of a restless intellect,
eagerly bent, however, on acquiring knowledge, and endowed with
great ability. He attended different universities in order to increase
his acquirements, and studied theology even at Rome. On his
return from Italy into Germany he established himself at Wittemberg,
and became doctor in divinity. "At this period," says he
himself afterwards, "I had not read the Holy Scriptures."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> This
account gives a very just idea of what the theology of that day was.
Carlstadt, besides being a professor, was a canon and archdeacon.
This is the person who was at a later period to make a rent in the
Reformation. In Luther at that time, he only saw an inferior, but
the Augustin soon became an object of jealousy to him. "I am
not willing," said he one day, "to be a smaller man than Luther."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
When Carlstadt conferred the highest university degree on his
future rival, he was far from foreseeing the celebrity which the
young professor was destined to obtain.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October, 1512, Luther was admitted a licentiate
in theology, and took the following oath:&mdash;"I swear to defend
evangelical truth by every means in my power."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The following
day, Bodenstein, in presence of a numerous assembly, formally
delivered to him the insignia of doctor of theology. He was made
Biblical doctor, not doctor of sentences, and in this way was called
to devote himself to the study of the Bible, and not to that of
human tradition.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The oath, then, which he took was, as he relates,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
to his well-beloved Holy Scripture. He promised to preach
it faithfully, to teach it purely, to study it during his whole life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and to defend it by discussion and by writing, as far as God
should enable him to do so.</p>

<p>This solemn oath was Luther's call to be the Reformer. In laying
it upon his conscience freely to seek, and boldly to announce
Christian truth, this oath raised the new doctor above the narrow
limits to which his monastic vow might perhaps have confined him.
Called by the university and by his sovereign, in the name of the
emperor, and of the See of Rome itself, and bound before God, by
the most solemn oath, he was thenceforth the intrepid herald of the
word of life. On this memorable day, Luther was dubbed knight
of the Bible.</p>

<p>Accordingly, this oath taken to the Holy Scriptures, may be
regarded as one of the causes of the renovation of the Church. The
infallible authority of the word of God alone was the first and
fundamental principle of the Reformation. All the reformations
in detail which took place at a later period, as reformations in doctrine,
in manners, in the government of the Church, and in worship,
were only consequences of this primary principle. One is
scarcely able at the present time to form an idea of the sensation
produced by this elementary principle, which is so simple in itself,
but which had been lost sight of for so many ages. Some individuals
of more extensive views than the generality, alone foresaw
its immense results. The bold voices of all the Reformers
soon proclaimed this powerful principle, at the sound of which
Rome is destined to crumble away:&mdash;"Christians, receive no other
doctrines than those which are founded on the express words of
Jesus Christ, his apostles, and prophets. No man, no assembly
of doctors, are entitled to prescribe new doctrines."</p>

<p>The situation of Luther was changed. The call which the Reformer
had received became to him like one of these extraordinary
calls which the Lord addressed to the prophets under the Old
Dispensation, and to the apostles under the New. The solemn
engagement which he undertook made so deep an impression on
his mind, that, in the sequel, the remembrance of this oath was
sufficient to console him amid the greatest dangers and the
sharpest conflicts. And when he saw all Europe agitated and
shaken by the word which he had announced; when it seemed that
the accusations of Rome, the reproaches of many pious men, and
the doubts and fears of his own easily agitated heart, would make
him hesitate, fear, and give way to despair, he called to mind the
oath which he had taken, and remained firm, tranquil, and full of
joy. "I have advanced in the name of the Lord," said he, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
critical occasion, "and I have put myself into his hands. His will
be done. Who asked him to make me a doctor? If He made
me, let him sustain me; or if he repents of having made me, let
Him depose me!.... This tribulation terrifies me not. I seek
one thing only, and it is to have the Lord favourable to me in all
that he calls me to do." Another time he said, "He who undertakes
any thing without a divine call, seeks his own glory; but I,
Doctor Martin Luther, was compelled to become a doctor. Papism
sought to stop me in the discharge of my duty, and you see what
has happened to it; and still worse will happen. They will not be
able to defend themselves against me. I desire, in the name of the
Lord, to tread upon the lions, and trample under foot the dragons
and vipers. This will commence during my life, and be finished
after my death."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>From the hour when he took the oath Luther sought the truth
solely for itself and for the Church. Still deeply impressed with
recollections of Rome, he saw indistinctly before him a course which
he determined to pursue with all the energy of his soul. The spiritual
life which had hitherto been manifested within him was now
manifested outwardly. This was the third period of his development.
His entrance into the convent had turned his thoughts
towards God: the knowledge of the forgiveness of sins and of the
righteousness of faith, had emancipated his soul; and his doctor's
oath gave him that baptism of fire by which he became the Reformer
of the Church.</p>

<p>His thoughts were soon directed in a general way to the subject
of reformation. In a discourse which he had written apparently with
a view to its being announced by the Provost of Litzkan, at the
Council of Lateran, he affirmed that the corruption of the world
was occasioned by the priests, who, instead of preaching the pure
word of God, taught so many fables and traditions. According
to him the word of life alone had power to accomplish the spiritual
regeneration of man. Hence, even at this period, he made
the salvation of the world depend on the re-establishment of sound
doctrine, and not on a mere reformation of manners. Luther was
not perfectly consistent with himself; he entertained contradictory
opinions; but a powerful intellect was displayed in all his writings.
He boldly broke the links by which the systems of the schools
chained down human thought, passed beyond the limits to which
past ages had attained, and formed new paths for himself. God
was in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>The first opponents whom he attacked were those famous schoolmen
whom he had so thoroughly studied, and who then reigned as
sovereigns in all universities. He accused them of Pelagianism;
and, forcibly assailing Aristotle, the father of the school, and
Thomas Aquinas, undertook to tumble both of them from the
throne on which they sat, the one ruling philosophy, and the other
theology.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> "Aristotle, Porphyry, the theologians of sentences,"
(the schoolmen,) wrote he to Lange, "are the lost studies of our
age.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> There is nothing I more ardently long for than to expose
this player, who has sported with the Church by wrapping himself
up in a Greek mask, and to make his disgrace apparent to all."
In all public disputations he was heard to say, "the writings of
the apostles and prophets are more certain and more sublime than
all the sophisms and all the theology of the school." Such
sayings were new, but people gradually became accustomed to them.
About a year after he could triumphantly write&mdash;"God works.
Our theology and St. Augustine make wonderful progress, and
reign in our university. Aristotle is on the decline, and is already
tottering to his speedy and eternal overthrow. The lessons on
the sentences are admirable for producing a yawn. No man
can hope to have an audience if he does not profess Biblical
theology."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Happy the university to which such a testimony can
be given.</p>

<p>At the same time that Luther attacked Aristotle, he took the
part of Erasmus and Reuchlin against their enemies. He entered
into communication with these great men and others of the learned,
such as Pirckheimer, Mutian, and Hütten, who belonged more or
less to the same party. At this period he formed another friendship
also, which was of great importance to him during his whole life.</p>

<p>There was then at the court of the elector a man distinguished
for wisdom and candour, named George Spalatin. Born at Spalatus
or Spalt, in the bishopric of Eichstadt, he had at first been
curate of the village of Hohenkirch, near the forest of Thuringia,
and was afterwards selected by Frederick the Wise to be his
secretary and chaplain, and also tutor to his nephew, John Frederick,
who was one day to wear the electoral crown. Spalatin
retained his simplicity in the midst of the court. He appeared
timid on the eve of great events, circumspect and prudent like his
master,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> when contrasted with the impetuous Luther, with whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was in daily correspondence. Like Staupitz he was made for
peaceful times. Such men are necessary, somewhat resembling
those delicate substances in which we wrap up jems and trinkets
to protect them from injury in travelling. They seem useless, and
yet without them the precious jewels would have been broken
and destroyed. Spalatin was not fitted to do great things, but
he faithfully and unostentatiously acquitted himself of the task
which had been assigned to him.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> He was at first one of the
principal assistants of his master in collecting those relics of
saints, of which Frederick was long an amateur, but gradually,
along with the prince, turned toward the truth. The faith which
was then re-appearing in the Church did not take the firm hold of
him that it did of Luther. He proceeded at a slower pace. He
became Luther's friend at court, the minister through whom all
affairs between the Reformer and the princes were transacted, the
mediator between the Church and the State. The elector honoured
Spalatin with his friendship; when on a journey they always travelled
in the same carriage.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> In other respects, the air of the court
often half suffocated the good chaplain. He took fits of melancholy,
and would have liked to quit all his honours, and be again a simple
pastor in the woods of Thuringia; but Luther consoled him, and
exhorted him to remain firm at his post. Spalatin acquired general
esteem; the princes and the learned of his time testifying the
sincerest regard for him. Erasmus said, "I inscribe the name of
Spalatin not only among those of my principal friends, but also
amongst those of my most venerated patrons; and this not on
paper but on my heart."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The affair of Reuchlin and the monks was then making a great
noise in Germany. The most pious men were often at a loss as
to the party which they ought to embrace; for the monks wished
to destroy Jewish books which contained blasphemies against
Christ. The doctor of Wittemberg being now in high repute, the
elector ordered his chaplain to consult him on this subject. The
following is Luther's reply. It is the first letter which he addressed
to the preacher of the court.</p>

<p>"What shall I say? These monks pretend to drive out Beelzebub,
but not by the finger of God. For this I cease not to lament
and groan. We Christians begin to be wise abroad, and we are
void of sense at home.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> On all the places of Jerusalem are blasphemies
a hundred times worse than those of the Jews. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
world is filled with spiritual idols. Inspired with a holy zeal, we
should put away and destroy these internal enemies, whereas we
leave the matter which is most pressing; the devil himself persuading
us to abandon our own business at the same time that he
prevents us from amending what belongs to others."</p>

<p>Luther did not lose himself in this quarrel. Living faith in
Christ filled his heart and his life. "In my heart," said he, "faith
in my Lord Jesus Christ reigns sole, and sole ought to reign. He
alone is the beginning, the middle, and the end, of all the thoughts
which occupy my mind night and day."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> He was always heard with
admiration when he spoke of this faith in Christ, whether in the professor's
chair or in the church. His lessons diffused light, and men
were astonished at not having sooner perceived truths which in his
mouth appeared so evident. "The desire of justifying ourselves,"
said he, "is the source of all anguish of heart, whereas he who
receives Jesus Christ as a Saviour has peace, and not only peace,
but purity of heart. Sanctification of the heart is entirely a fruit of
faith; for faith is in us a Divine work, which changes us, and gives
us a new birth, emanating from God himself. It kills Adam in us
by the Holy Spirit, which it communicates to us, giving us a new
heart, and making us new men. "It is not by hollow speculation,"
exclaimed he again, "but by this practical method that we
obtain a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>At this time Luther preached discourses on the Ten Commandments,
which have come down to us under the name of <i>Popular
Declamations</i>. Undoubtedly there are errors in them; for Luther
himself was enlightened only by degrees. "The path of the just
is like the shining light, which shineth more and more unto the
perfect day." But in these discourses what truth! what simplicity!
what eloquence! How easy to conceive the effect which the
new preacher must have produced upon his audience and his age!
We will quote only one passage taken from the commencement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Luther goes up into the pulpit of Wittemberg, and gives out
these words, "Thou shalt have no other god before me." Then
addressing himself to the people who filled the church, he says,
"All the sons of Adam are idolaters, and guilty of violating this
First Commandment."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> This strange assertion no doubt surprises
his hearers. He must therefore justify it, and accordingly proceeds:&mdash;"There
are two kinds of idolatry, the one without, the
other within.</p>

<p>"The one without is, when man worships wood and stone, beasts
and stars.</p>

<p>"The one within is, when man, fearing punishment or seeking
his ease, does not give worship to the creature, but loves it internally,
and confides in it.</p>

<p>"What religion is this? You do not bend the knee before riches
and honours, but you offer them your heart, the noblest part of
you. Ah! you worship God with the body, and with the spirit
you worship the creature.</p>

<p>"This idolatry reigns in every man until he is cured of it freely
by the faith which is in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"And how is this cure performed?</p>

<p>"In this way. Faith in Christ strips you of all confidence in
your own wisdom, your own righteousness, your own strength.
It tells you that if Christ had not died for you, and so saved you,
neither yourself nor any creature could have done it.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Then you
learn to despise all those things which remained useless to you.</p>

<p>"There now remains to you only Jesus; Jesus alone; Jesus
fully sufficient for your soul. No longer having any hopes in the
creatures, you have now Christ only, in whom you hope all, and
whom you love above all. Now Jesus is the sole, the only, the
true God. When you have him for God you have no longer other
gods."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>It is thus Luther shows how, by the gospel, the soul is brought
back to God its sovereign good, agreeably to the words of Jesus
Christ, "I am the way; no man cometh unto the Father but by
me." The man who speaks thus to his age is not merely desirous to
overthrow some abuses; he is first of all desirous to establish true
religion. His work is not negative merely&mdash;it is primarily positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>Luther afterwards directs his discourse against the superstitions
with which Christendom then abounded, against signs and mysterious
characters, observations of certain days and certain months,
familiar demons, ghosts, the influence of the stars and wizards,
metamorphoses, incubuses and succubuses, the patronage of saints,
etc., etc. He attacks these idols one after the other, and vigorously
casts down these false gods.</p>

<p>But it was at the university especially, in presence of enlightened
youths, eager for truth, that Luther laid open all the treasures
of the word of God. "His mode of explaining the Scriptures,"
says his illustrious friend, Melancthon, "was such, that in the
judgment of all pious and enlightened men it was as if a new
light had risen upon doctrine after a long dark night. He pointed
out the difference between the Law and the Gospel. He refuted
the error then prevalent in churches and schools, that men merit
the forgiveness of sins by their own works, and are rendered
righteous before God by means of external discipline. He thus
brought back the hearts of men to the Son of God.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Like John
the Baptist, he pointed to the Lamb of God, who had taken
away the sins of the world. He explained how sins are pardoned
freely for the sake of the Son of God, and how man receives the
blessing through faith. He made no change in ceremonies; on the
contrary, the established discipline had not, in his order a more
faithful observer and defender. But he laboured more and more
to make all comprehend the great and essential doctrines of conversion,
of the forgiveness of sins, of faith, and the true consolation
which is to be found in the cross. The pious were charmed
and penetrated with the sweetness of this doctrine, while the
learned received it gladly.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> One would have said that Christ,
the apostles and prophets, were coming forth from darkness and a
loathsome dungeon."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The firmness with which Luther fortified himself by Scripture
gave great authority to his teaching, while other circumstances
added to his power. His life corresponded to his words&mdash;his discourses
were not merely from the life,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> they came from the heart,
and were exemplified in all his conduct. And when the Reformation
burst forth many influential men, who were much grieved
at seeing the rents that were made in the Church, won over by
the Reformer's purity of conduct, and his admirable talents, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
only did not oppose him, but even embraced the doctrine to which
his works bore testimony.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The more they loved Christian virtue
the more they inclined to the Reformer. All honest theologians
were in his favour.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Such is the testimony of those who knew
him, in particular of Melancthon, the wisest man of his age, and
Erasmus, Luther's celebrated opponent. Yet prejudice has dared to
speak of his debauchery. Wittemberg was changed by this preaching
of faith, and became the focus of a light which was soon to
illumine Germany, and diffuse itself over all the Church.</p>

<p>In 1516, Luther published a treatise by an anonymous mystic
theologian, (probably Ebland, priest at Frankfort,) entitled <i>German
Theology</i>, wherein the author shows how man may attain
perfection by the three methods of purification, illumination, and
communion. Luther never plunged into mystical theology, but
he received a salutary impression from it. It confirmed him in the
disgust which he felt for dry scholastics&mdash;in his contempt for the
works and observances so much dwelt upon by the Church&mdash;in his
conviction of man's spiritual impotence, and of the necessity of
grace, and in his attachment to the Bible. "To the schoolmen,"<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
wrote he to Staupitz, "I prefer the Mystics and the Bible;" thus
placing the Mystics by the side of the inspired writers. Perhaps
the <i>German Theology</i> also assisted him in forming a sounder
idea of the sacraments, and especially of the mass. For the author
of that work insists that the Eucharist gives Christ to man, but
does not offer Christ to God. Luther accompanied this publication
with a preface, in which he declared, that next to the Bible
and St. Augustine, there was no book he had ever met with, from
which he had learned more respecting God, Christ, man, and all
things. Already several doctors had begun to inveigh against the
Professors of Wittemberg, and to accuse them of innovation. "One
would suppose," continues Luther, "that there never were men
before us who taught as we do; yea, verily, there were. But the
wrath of God, which our sins have deserved, did not permit us to
see them, and to hear them. For a long time the universities
kept the word of God lying in a corner. Let them read this
book, and then tell me if our theology is new; for this book is not
new."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But if Luther took all the good that was in mystical
theology, he took not the bad that was in it. The great error in
mysticism is, to overlook a free salvation. We are going to see a
remarkable example of the purity of Luther's faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Luther, possessed of a tender and affectionate heart, was desirous
to see those whom he loved in possession of the light which
had guided him into the paths of peace; and availed himself of all
the opportunities which he had, as professor, preacher, and monk,
as well as of his extensive correspondence, to communicate his treasure
to others. One of his old brethren of the convent of Erfurt,
the monk George Spenlein, was then in the convent of Memmingen.
After having spent some time at Wittemberg, Spenlein had
asked the doctor to sell different articles which he had left, viz.,
a tunic of Brussels cloth, a work of a doctor of Isenach, and a
monk's frock. Luther carefully executed this commission. "I
have received," said he to Spenlein, in a letter, 7th April 1516, "a
florin for the tunic, half a florin for the book, and a florin for the
frock, and have remitted the whole to the father-vicar," to whom
Spenlein owed three florins. But Luther passes quickly from
this account of monastic spoils to a more important subject.</p>

<p>"I should like much," says he to friar George, "to know how it
is with your soul. Is it not weary of its own righteousness? does
it not breathe at length and confide in the righteousness of Christ?
In our day pride seduces many, especially those who do their
utmost to become righteous. Not comprehending the righteousness
which is freely given us of God in Christ Jesus, they would
stand before him by their merits. But that cannot be. When
you lived with us you were in this error, as I also was. I am
still constantly fighting with it; and have not yet completely
triumphed.</p>

<p>"O my dear brother, learn to know Christ and Christ crucified.
Learn to sing unto him a new song; to despair of thyself, and
say, 'Thou, O Lord Jesus! thou art my righteousness, and I am
thy sin! Thou hast taken what is mine, and given me what is
thine.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> What thou wert not thou hast become, in order that
what I was not I might become.' Take care, O my dear George,
not to pretend to such a purity as will make you unwilling to
acknowledge yourself a sinner; for Christ dwells in sinners only.
He came down from heaven, where he dwelt among the righteous,
that he might dwell also among sinners. Meditate carefully on
this love of Christ, and thou wilt derive ineffable blessing from it.
If our labours and our afflictions could give us peace of conscience,
why should Christ have died? Thou wilt find peace only in him,
by despairing of thyself and of thy works, and learning with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
love he opens his arms to thee, takes upon him all thy sins, and
gives thee all his righteousness."</p>

<p>Thus the powerful doctrine which had already saved the world
in the days of the Apostles, and which was to save it a second
time in the days of the Reformers, was expounded by Luther with
force and clearness. Stretching over numerous ages of ignorance
and superstition, he here shook hands with St. Paul.</p>

<p>Spenlein was not the only person whom he sought to instruct
in this fundamental doctrine. He felt uneasy at the little truth
which he discovered in this respect in the writings of Erasmus.
It was of importance to enlighten a man whose authority was so
great, and whose genius was so admirable. But how was he to do
it? His friend at court, the elector's chaplain, was respected by
Erasmus; and it is to him Luther addresses himself. "My dear
Spalatin, the thing which displeases me in Erasmus, that man of
vast erudition, is, that by the righteousness of works or of the
law, of which the apostle speaks, he understands the fulfilment of
the ceremonial law. The justification of the law consists not in
ceremonies only, but in all the works of the Decalogue. When
these works are performed without faith in Christ, they may, it is
true, make Fabriciuses, Reguluses, and other men of strict integrity
in the eyes of the world, but then they as little deserve to be
called righteousness, as the fruit of a medlar to be called a fig.
For we do not become righteous, as Aristotle pretends, by doing
works of righteousness; but when we have become righteous we do
such works.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The man must first be changed, and then the works.
Abel was first pleasing to God, and then his sacrifice." Luther
continues, "I pray you, fulfil the duty of a friend and of a Christian,
by making Erasmus acquainted with those things." This
letter is dated "In haste, from the corner of our convent, 19th
Oct., 1516." It gives a true view of the footing on which Luther
stood with Erasmus, and shows the sincere interest which he felt
in whatever he thought truly advantageous to this distinguished
writer. No doubt, at a later period, the opposition of Erasmus to
the truth forced Luther to combat him openly, but it was only
after he had sought to enlighten his opponent.</p>

<p>At length those views on the nature of goodness were propounded
which were at once clear and profound, and the great
truth was distinctly proclaimed, that the real goodness of a work
consists not in its external form, but in the spirit in which it is
done. Thus giving a mortal blow to all the superstitious observances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which had for ages choked the Church, and prevented
Christian virtues from growing and flourishing in it.</p>

<p>"I read Erasmus," again writes Luther, "but he is every day
losing his credit with me. I like to see him, with so much skill
and firmness, rebuking priests and monks for their loathsome ignorance,
but I fear he will not do great service to the doctrine of
Jesus Christ. What is of man has more hold on his heart than
what is of God.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> We live in dangerous times. A man is not a
good and judicious Christian because he understands Greek and
Hebrew. Jerome, who knew five languages, is inferior to Augustine,
who only knew one, though Erasmus thinks differently. I
am very careful to conceal my sentiments concerning Erasmus,
lest I should give an advantage to his opponents. It may be
the Lord will give him understanding in his own time."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The impotence of man, and the omnipotence of God, were the
two truths which Luther wished to re-establish. It is a sad religion
and a sad philosophy which throws man back upon his natural
powers. Ages have made trial of these boasted powers, and
while man has of himself succeeded wonderfully in things which
concern his earthly existence, he has never been able to dissipate
the darkness which hides the true knowledge of God from his mind,
nor to change a single inclination of his heart. The highest degree
of wisdom attained by ambitious intellects, or minds inflamed
with ardent longings after perfection, has only plunged them into
despair.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The doctrine, therefore, which unveils to us our impotence,
in order to acquaint us with a Divine power, which shall enable
us to do all things, is a generous, consoling, and perfectly true
doctrine; and the reformation which exhibits the glory of heaven
on the earth, and pleads the rights of Almighty God with men, is
a great reformation.</p>

<p>But nobody was better aware than Luther of the intimate and
indissoluble tie which unites the gratuitous salvation of God with
the free works of man. Nobody showed better than he that it is
only by receiving all from Christ that man can give much to his
brethren. He always presented the two acts, that of God and
that of man, in the same picture. Thus, after having explained
to friar Spenlein wherein saving righteousness consists, he adds
"If you believe these things firmly as you ought to do, (for
cursed is he who believeth not,) receive thy still ignorant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
erring brethren as Jesus Christ has received thee. Bear with
them patiently, make their sins thy own, and if thou hast any
thing good, communicate it unto them. Receive one another, saith
the Apostle, as Christ hath received us to the glory of God. It is
a sad righteousness which will not bear with others, because it
finds them wicked, and which thinks only of seeking the solitude
of the desert, instead of doing them good by patience, prayer, and
example. If thou art the lily and the rose of Christ, know that
thy dwelling is among the thorns. Only take care that thou do not
by thy impatience, thy rash judgments, and thy hidden pride, become
thyself a thorn. Christ reigns in the midst of his enemies.
Had he been pleased to live only among the good, and to die only
for those who loved him, for whom, I ask, would he have died, and
among whom would he have lived?"</p>

<p>It is touching to see how Luther himself carried these precepts
of charity into practice. An Augustin of Erfurt, named George
Leiffer, was subjected to severe trials. Luther learned it, and
eight days after he had written the letter to Spenlein, went up
to him kindly, and said&mdash;"I learn that you are agitated by many
tempests, and that your spirit is tossed up and down upon the
billows.... The cross of Christ is portioned out over all the
earth, and each one receives his part. Do not you, then, reject
that which is fallen to you. Rather receive it as a holy relic, not
in a vessel of gold and of silver, but what is far better, in a
heart of gold&mdash;a heart full of meekness. If the wood of the cross
has been so sanctified by the blood and flesh of Christ, that we
consider it to be the most venerable relic, how much more ought
we to regard the injuries, persecutions, inflictions, and hatred of
men as holy relics, since they have not only been touched by the
flesh of Christ, but embraced, kissed, and blessed by his boundless
love?"<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The instructions of Luther bore fruit. Several of his disciples
already felt themselves urged publicly to profess the truths which
the lessons of their master had revealed to them. Among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hearers was a learned youth, named Bernard of Feldkirchen, professor
of the physics of Aristotle in the university, and who, five
years afterwards, was the first of the evangelical ecclesiastics who
entered into the bond of matrimony.</p>

<p>Luther, while he was presiding, desired Feldkirchen to maintain
theses in which his principles were expounded. The doctrines
professed by Luther thus acquired new publicity. The
disputation took place in 1516, and was Luther's first attack on
the reign of the sophists and the Papacy. However feeble it
was, it gave him considerable uneasiness. "I allow these propositions
to be printed," said he, many years after, on publishing
them in his works, "principally in order that the greatness of my
cause, and the success with which God has crowned it, may not
puff me up. For they fully manifest my shame; that is to say,
the infirmity and ignorance, the fear and trembling, with which I
commenced this struggle. I was alone, and had imprudently
plunged into this affair. Not being able to draw back, I conceded
several important points to the pope, and even adored him."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>The following are some of these propositions:<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The old man is vanity of vanities&mdash;he is wholly vanity, and
renders all other creatures vain, how good soever they be.</p>

<p>"The old man is called <i>the flesh</i>, not only because he is led by
sensual lusts, but also because, even though he were chaste, prudent,
and just, he is not born anew of God by the Spirit.</p>

<p>"A man who is without the grace of God cannot observe the
commands of God, nor prepare himself, in whole or in part, to receive
grace, but necessarily remains under sin.</p>

<p>"The will of man without grace is not free, but enslaved, and
that voluntarily.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ, our strength and our righteousness, who trieth
the hearts and reins, is alone the Searcher and Judge of our merits.</p>

<p>"Since everything is possible through Christ to him who believeth,
it is superstitious to seek other aid, whether in the will of
man or in the saints."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>This disputation made a great noise, and has been considered
as the commencement of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The moment approached when this reformation was to burst
forth. God was hastening to prepare the instrument which he
meant to employ. The elector having built a new church at Wittemberg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to which he gave the name of "All-Saints," sent Staupitz
into the Netherlands to collect the relics with which he was
desirous to enrich it. The vicar-general ordered Luther to take
his place during his absence, and in particular to pay a visit to
forty monasteries in Misnia and Thuringia.</p>

<p>Luther repaired first to Grimma, and thence to Dresden, everywhere
labouring to establish the truths which he had ascertained,
and to enlighten the members of his own order. "Don't attach
yourself to Aristotle, or to other teachers of a deceitful philosophy,"
said he to the monks, "but diligently read the word of God.
Seek not your salvation in your own strength, and your own
good works, but in the merits of Christ, and in Divine grace."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>An Augustin monk of Dresden had run off from his convent, and
was living at Mayence, where the prior of the Augustins had received
him. Luther wrote to the prior<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> to demand restitution of
the lost sheep, and added these words, which are full of truth and
charity, "I know that offences must come. It is no wonder that
man falls; but it is a wonder he rises again, and stands erect.
Peter fell, in order that he might know that he was a man; and
we still see the cedar of Lebanon fall. Angels even (a thing
which surpasses our comprehension) fell in heaven, and Adam
fell in paradise. Why then be astonished when a reed is shaken
by the wind, and the smoking flax is quenched?" From Dresden,
Luther proceeded to Erfurt, to do the duties of vicar-general in the
very convent where, eleven years before, he had wound up the
clock, opened the door, and swept the Church. He appointed his
friend, bachelor John Lange, a learned and pious, but austere
man, prior of the convent, exhorting him to affability and patience.
Shortly after he wrote him, "Show a spirit of meekness towards
the prior of Nuremberg. This is fitting, inasmuch as the prior has
put on a sour and bitter spirit. Bitter is not expelled by bitter,
that is to say, devil by devil; but sweet expels bitter, that is to
say, the finger of God casts out demons."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>It must perhaps be regretted, that on different occasions Luther
did not remember this excellent advice.</p>

<p>At Neustadt on Orla there was nothing but division. Quarrelling
and disturbance reigned in the convent. All the monks
were at war with the prior, and assailed Luther with their complaints.
The prior, Michael Dressel, or Tornator, as Luther calls
him, translating his name into Latin, on his part explained all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
grievances to the doctor. "Peace! peace!" said he. "You seek
peace," replied Luther, "but you seek the peace of the world, and
not that of Christ. Know you not that our God has placed his
peace in the midst of war? He whom nobody troubles has no
peace. But he who, troubled by all men, and by all the things of
life, bears all calmly and joyfully, possesses true peace. You say,
with Israel, Peace, peace; and there is no peace. Say rather with
Christ, The cross, the cross; and there will be no cross. For the
cross ceases to be a cross as soon as we can sincerely say with
joy, O blessed cross, there is no wood like thine!"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> After his return
to Wittemberg, Luther, wishing to put an end to these divisions
allowed the monks to elect another prior.</p>

<p>Luther returned to Wittemberg after an absence of six weeks.
He was grieved at all that he had seen, but the journey gave him
a better acquaintance with the Church and the world; gave him
more confidence in his intercourse with men and furnished him
with numerous opportunities of founding schools, and urging this
fundamental truth, that "the Holy Scripture alone shows us the
way to heaven," and to exhort the brethren to live together
holily, chastely, and peacefully.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Doubtless, much seed was sown
in the different Augustin convents during this journey of the
Reformer. The monastic orders, which had long been the stay of
Rome, perhaps did more for the Reformation than against it.
This is true especially of the order of Augustins. Almost all
pious men of a free and exalted spirit who were in cloisters, turned
to the gospel, and a new and noble blood soon circulated in their
orders, which were in a manner the arteries of German Catholicity.
The world knew nothing of the new ideas of the Augustin
of Wittemberg, after they had become the great subject of conversation
in chapters and monasteries. In this way, more than one
cloister was a seminary of reformers. At the moment when the
great blow was struck, pious and brave men came forth from
their obscurity, and abandoned the retreat of the monastic life, for
the active career of ministers of the word of God. Even during
the inspection of 1516, Luther by his words awoke many slumbering
spirits, and hence this year has been called "the morning
star of the gospel day."</p>

<p>Luther resumed his ordinary avocations. At this period he was
oppressed with work; it was not enough that he was professor,
preacher, and confessor; he had, moreover, a variety of temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
business connected with his order and his convent. "I almost
constantly require two clerks," wrote he; "for I do little else the
whole day than write letters. I am preacher to the convent,
chaplain at table, pastor and parish minister, director of studies,
vice-prior, which means prior eleven times over, inspector of
the ponds of Litzkau, advocate of the inns of Herzberg at Torgau,
reader of St. Paul, commentator on the Psalms.... I have
seldom time to say my Hours and chant,&mdash;to say nothing of my
combat with flesh and blood, the devil and the world.... See
how lazy a man I am."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>About this time the plague broke out in Wittemberg, and a great
part of the students and teachers left the town. Luther remained.
"I don't well know," wrote he to his friend at Erfurt,
"if the plague will allow me to finish the Epistle to the Galatians.
Prompt and brisk, it makes great ravages, especially among the
young. You advise me to flee. Whither shall I flee? I hope the
world will not go to wreck though friar Martin fall.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> If the plague
makes progress, I will disperse the friars in all directions, but for
myself I am stationed here, and obedience permits me not to flee,
till he who has called me recall me. Not that I do not fear death,
(for I am not the Apostle Paul, I am only his commentator;) but
I hope the Lord will deliver me from fear." Such was the firmness
of the doctor of Wittemberg. Will he, whom the plague
could not force to recoil one step, recoil before Rome? Will he
yield to the power of the scaffold?</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Relations of Luther with the Elector&mdash;Luther and the Elector&mdash;Counsels to the
Chaplain&mdash;Duke George&mdash;His Character&mdash;Luther before the Court&mdash;Dinner at
Court&mdash;Emser's Supper.</p></blockquote>


<p>The same courage which Luther displayed in presence of most
formidable evils, he displayed in presence of the great. The
elector was much pleased with the vicar-general, who had made a
good collection of relics in the Netherlands. Luther gives an account
of it to Spalatin. There is something curious in this affair
of relics occurring at the moment when the Reformation is about
to commence. Assuredly the Reformers had little idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
point at which they were to arrive. A bishopric seemed to the
elector only a fit recompence to the vicar-general. Luther, to
whom Spalatin wrote on the subject, strongly disapproved of it.
"Many things," replied he, "please your prince, which, however,
displease God. I deny not his ability in the affairs of the
world, but in what concerns God and the salvation of souls, I account
him seven-fold blind as well as his counsellor Pfeffinger. I
say not this behind their backs like a slanderer; don't hide it
from them, for I am ready to say it personally to both. Why,"
continues he, "would you environ this man with all the whirlwinds
and tempests of episcopal cares?"<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>The elector did not take Luther's frankness in bad part. "The
prince," says Spalatin in a letter to him, "often speaks of you,
and with much respect." Frederick sent the monk stuff to make
a cassock of very fine cloth. "It would be too fine," said Luther,
"were it not the gift of a prince. I am unworthy that any man
should think of me, far less that a prince should, and so great a
prince. The most useful persons to me are those who think the
most ill of me.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Return thanks to our prince for his favour; but
know that I desire not to be praised by you, or by any man&mdash;all
praise of man being vain, and the praise which cometh from God
alone being true."</p>

<p>The excellent chaplain did not wish to confine himself to his
court functions. He desired to render himself useful to the people;
but, like many of all times, he wished to do it without giving
offence. He not only wished not to irritate any one, but, on the
contrary, to conciliate general favour. "Point out," says he to
Luther, "some work which I may translate into our mother
tongue, a work which will please generally, and at the same time
be useful." "Agreeable and useful!" replies Luther; "the request
is beyond me. The better things are, the less they please.
What is more salutary than Jesus Christ? And yet to most he
is a savour of death. You will tell me that you wish to be useful
to those who love what is good. In that case, just let the
voice of Christ be heard. You will be agreeable and useful, depend
upon it; but it will be to a very small number: for the sheep are
rare in this region of wolves."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Luther, however, recommended to his friend the sermons of
Tauler. "I have never seen," said he, "either in Latin or our
own tongue a sounder theology, or one more agreeable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
gospel. Taste and see how sweet the Lord is; but be it after you
have tasted and seen how bitter every thing is that is ours."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>It was in the course of the year 1517 that Luther entered into
communication with Duke George of Saxony. The House of
Saxony had then two heads. The princes, Ernest and Albert,
carried off in their youth from the castle of Altenbourg by Kunz
of Kaufungen, had, by the treaty of Leipsic, become the founders
of the two houses which still bear their name. The Elector
Frederick, the son of Ernest, at the period of which we write,
was the chief of the Ernestine branch, while his brother, Duke
George, was chief of the Albertine branch. Dresden and Leipsic
were in the states of the duke, who had his residence in the former
of these cities. His mother, Sidonia, was daughter of George
Podiebrad, King of Bohemia. The long struggle which Bohemia
had maintained with Rome, from the days of John Huss, had had
some influence on the prince of Saxony, and he had often shown
a desire for a reformation. "He has sucked it from his mother,"
it was said: "he is by birth an enemy of the clergy."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He in
various ways annoyed the bishops, abbots, canons, and monks,
in so much that his cousin, the elector, was more than once
obliged to interpose in their behalf. It might have been supposed
that Duke George would be a warm partisan of the Reformation.
Devout Frederick, on the contrary, who had once put on
the spurs of Gregory in the Holy Sepulchre, girt himself with
the great ponderous sword of the conqueror of Jerusalem, and
taking an oath to combat for the Church, like a bold knight,
might have been expected to prove one of the most eager champions
of Rome. But when the gospel is in question, the anticipations
of human wisdom are often at fault. The result was the opposite
of what might have been supposed. The duke would have taken
pleasure in humbling the Church, and those connected with it,
and lowering the bishops, whose princely train far surpassed his
own; but to receive into his heart the evangelical doctrine which
must have humbled it, to acknowledge himself a guilty sinner, incapable
of being saved, unless through grace, was quite a different
matter. He would willingly have reformed others, but he
had no desire to reform himself. He would, perhaps, have assisted
in obliging the bishop of Mentz to be contented with a single
bishopric, and have no more than fourteen horses in his stable, as
he himself repeatedly expressed it;<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> but when he saw another
than himself appear as reformer,&mdash;when he saw a mere monk undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the work,&mdash;and the Reformation gaining numerous adherents
among the humbler classes,&mdash;the haughty grandson of the
Hussite king became the most violent adversary of the reform of
which he had at first promised to be a partisan.</p>

<p>In July 1517, Duke George asked Staupitz to send him a
learned and eloquent preacher. Staupitz sent Luther representing
him as a man of great learning and irreproachable character.
The prince invited him to preach at Dresden, in the chapel of the
castle on the feast of St. James the Elder.</p>

<p>On the day fixed the duke and his court proceeded to the
chapel to hear the preacher of Wittemberg.</p>

<p>Luther gladly seized the occasion to bear testimony to the truth
before such an assembly. He took for his text the gospel of the
day, "Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her
sons." (Matth., xx, 20-25.) He preached on the wishes and rash
prayers of men; then dwelt strongly on the assurance of salvation,
making it rest on this foundation, viz., That those who hear
the word of God with faith are the true disciples, whom Jesus
Christ has elected unto eternal life. He next treated of eternal
election, showing that this doctrine, when exhibited in connection
with the work of Christ, is well fitted to calm the terrors of
conscience, and so, instead of disposing men to flee from God,
allures them to seek their refuge in Him. In conclusion, he
brought forward a parable of three virgins, and drew a very instructive
improvement from it.</p>

<p>The word of truth made a deep impression on the hearers.
Two in particular appeared to give earnest attention to the discourse
of the monk of Wittemberg. The one was a respectable
looking lady who sat in one of the court pews, and whose features
bespoke deep emotion. It was Madam de la Sale, grand mistress to
the duchess. The other was Jerome Emser, a licentiate in canon
law, and secretary and counsellor to the duke. Emser was a man
of talent and extensive information. A courtier and able politician,
his wish would have been to please both parties at once; to
pass at Rome for a defender of the papacy, and at the same time
figure in Germany among the learned men of the age. But under
this flexible spirit a violent temper lay concealed. Thus Luther
and Emser, who were afterwards repeatedly to break a lance,
met for the first time in the chapel of the castle of Dresden.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell having rung for the inmates of the castle, the
ducal family and the persons attached to the court were soon
seated at the table. The conversation naturally turned on the
preacher of the morning. "How did you like the sermon?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the duke to Madam de la Sale. "Could I again hear such
another discourse," replied she, "I could die in peace." "And
I," replied George, angrily, "would give a good sum not to have
heard it. Such discourses are good only to make people sin with
confidence."</p>

<p>The master having thus stated his opinion, the courtiers proceded
without restraint to express their dissatisfaction. Every
one was ready with his remark. Some alleged, that in the parable
of the three virgins, Luther had had three ladies of the court
in his eye. On this the talk was endless. They rallied the three
ladies whom they affirmed that Luther had intended.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> He is an
ignorant blockhead, said one. He is a proud monk, said another.
Each had his comment on the sermon, making the preacher say
whatever he pleased. The truth had fallen into the midst of a
court ill prepared to receive it. Every one tore it at pleasure.
But while the word of God was to many an occasion of stumbling,
to the grand mistress it was a stone "elect and precious."
Falling sick about a month after, she confidently embraced the
grace of the Saviour, and died rejoicing.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the duke, perhaps the testimony which he had
heard given to the truth was not in vain. However much he opposed
the Reformation during his life, it is known that in his last
moments he declared, that his only hope was in the merits of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>It naturally fell to Emser to do the honours to Luther in his
master's name. He accordingly invited him to supper. Luther
refused; but Emser insisted and constrained him to come. Luther
only expected to meet a few friends, but he soon perceived that a
trap had been laid for him.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> A master of arts from Leipsic, and
several Dominicans, were with the prince's secretary. The master
of arts, who had an overweening opinion of himself, and a deep
hatred of Luther, accosted him with a bland and friendly air; but
he soon broke out, and screamed at full pitch.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The battle began.
"The discussion," says Luther, "turned on the absurdities of Aristotle
and St. Thomas."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> At last Luther challenged the master of
arts, with all the erudition of the Thomists, to define what it was
to fulfil the commandments of God. The master of arts, though
embarrassed, put on a good countenance. "Pay me my fees," says
he, stretching out his hand, "<i>da pastum</i>." One would have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he was going to give a lesson in form, mistaking the guests for his
pupils. "At this foolish reply," adds the Reformer, "we all burst
a laughing, and the party broke up."</p>

<p>During the conversation, a Dominican had been listening at the
door, and would fain have come in to spit in Luther's face.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> He
refrained, however, though he afterwards made a boast of it.

<h2>CHAP. XI</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Return to Wittemberg&mdash;Theses&mdash;Nature of Man&mdash;Rationalism&mdash;Demand at Erfurt&mdash;Eck&mdash;Urban
Regius&mdash;Luther's Modesty.</p></blockquote>


<p>Luther zealously resumed his labours. He was preparing six
or seven young theologians, who were forthwith to undergo an
examination in order to obtain a licence to teach. And what most
delighted him was, that their promotion was to be to Aristotle's
disgrace. "I should like," said he, "to multiply his enemies
as fast as possible."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> With that view, he at this time published
Theses, which deserve attention.</p>

<p>The leading topic which he discussed was <i>liberty</i>. He had already
glanced at it in the theses of Feldkirchen, but now went
deeper into it. Ever since Christianity began, there has been a
struggle, more or less keen, between the opposite doctrines of the
freedom and the slavery of man. Some schoolmen had taught, like
Pelagius and others, that man possessed in himself the liberty or
power of loving God and doing good. Luther denied this liberty,
not to deprive man of it, but, on the contrary, to make him obtain
it. The struggle, then, in this great question, is not, as is usually
said, between liberty and servitude; but between a liberty proceeding
from man, and a liberty proceeding from God. Some who
call themselves the advocates of liberty, say to man, "You have
the power of doing good, and require a greater liberty." Others,
who have been called advocates of slavery, say to him, on the
contrary, "You have no true liberty; but God offers it to you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the gospel." The one party speaks of liberty, but a liberty which
must end in slavery; while the other speaks of slavery, in order to
give liberty. Such was the struggle in the time of St. Paul, in the
time of Augustine, and in the time of Luther. Those who say
"Change nothing!" are champions of slavery. Those who say
"Let your fetters fall!" are champions of liberty.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the whole Reformation
can be summed up in this particular question. It is one
of the many doctrines which the Wittemberg doctor maintained&mdash;that
is all. It would, above all, be a strange illusion to hold, that
the Reformation was fatalism, or an opposition to liberty. It was
a magnificent emancipation of the human mind. Bursting the
numerous bands with which thought had been bound by the hierarchy,
and reviving the ideas of liberty, right, and examination, it
delivered its own age, and with it ours also, and the remotest posterity.
And let it not be said that the Reformation, while it freed
man from human despotism, enslaved him by proclaiming the sovereignty
of grace. No doubt, it wished to bring back the human
will to the Divine, to subordinate the one, and completely merge
it in the other; but what philosopher knows not that entire conformity
to the will of God alone constitutes sovereign, perfect
freedom; and that man will never be truly free, until supreme
righteousness and truth have sole dominion over him?</p>

<p>The following are some of the Ninety-nine Propositions which
Luther sent forth into the Church, in opposition to the Pelagian
rationalism of scholastic theology.</p>

<p>"It is true that man, who is become a corrupt tree, can only
will and do what is evil.</p>

<p>"It is not true that the will, when left to itself, can do good as
well as evil; for it is not free but captive.</p>

<p>"It is not in the power of the will of man to choose or reject
whatever is presented to it.</p>

<p>"Man cannot naturally wish God to be God. His wish is that
he himself were God, and that God were no God.</p>

<p>"The excellent, infallible, and sole preparation for grace, is the
eternal election and predestination of God.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>"It is false to say that when man does all he can, he clears
away the obstacles to grace.</p>

<p>"In one word, nature possesses neither a pure reason nor a
good will.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"On the part of man, there is nothing which precedes grace,
unless it be impotence and even rebellion.</p>

<p>"There is no moral virtue without pride or sullenness, that is
to say, without sin.</p>

<p>"From the beginning to the end we are not the masters of our
actions, but the slaves of them.</p>

<p>"We do not become righteous by doing what is righteous, but
having become righteous we do what is righteous.</p>

<p>"He who says that a theologian who is not a logician is a
heretic and an adventurer, maintains an adventurous and heretical
proposition.</p>

<p>"There is no form of reasoning (syllogism) which accords with
the things of God.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>"If the form of the syllogism could be applied to divine things,
we should know the article of the Holy Trinity, and should not
believe it.</p>

<p>"In one word, Aristotle is to theology as darkness to light.</p>

<p>"Man is more hostile to the grace of God than he is to the law
itself.</p>

<p>"He who is without the grace of God sins incessantly, even
though he neither kills, nor steals, nor commits adultery.</p>

<p>"He sins, for he does not fulfil the law spiritually.</p>

<p>"Not to kill, and not to commit adultery, externally, and in
regard to action, merely, is the righteousness of hypocrites.</p>

<p>"The law of God and the will of man are two adversaries, who,
without the grace of God, can never agree.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>"What the law wishes the will never wishes; only from fear
it may make a show of wishing.</p>

<p>"The law is the hangman of the will, and is subject only to
the Child who has been born unto us.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> (Isaiah, ix, 6.)</p>

<p>"The law makes sin abound; for it irritates and repulses the
will.</p>

<p>"But the grace of God makes righteousness abound, through
Jesus Christ, who makes us love the law.</p>

<p>"Every work of the law appears good externally, but internally
is sin.</p>

<p>"The will, when it turns toward the law without the grace of
God, does so only for its own interest.</p>

<p>"Cursed are those who do the works of the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>"Blessed are all those who do the works of the grace of God.</p>

<p>"The law, which is good, and in which we have life, is the law
of the love of God, shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
(Rom., v, 5.)</p>

<p>"Grace is not given in order that works may be done more frequently
and more easily, but because without grace there cannot
be any work of love.</p>

<p>"To love God is to hate oneself, and know nothing out of
God."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>In this way Luther attributes to God all the good that man can
do. The thing to be done is not to repair, or, so to speak, to patch
up the will of man; an entirely new will must be given him. God
alone could say this; for God alone could perform it. This is one
of the greatest and most important truths that the will of man can
acknowledge.</p>

<p>But Luther, while proclaiming the impotence of man, did not
fall into the opposite extreme. He says in the eighth thesis, "It
follows not that the will is naturally bad, that is to say, that its
nature is of the essence of evil, as the Manichees taught."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Originally
the nature of man was essentially good; but it turned aside
from goodness, that is, God, and is inclined to evil. Still its origin
remains holy and glorious, and is capable, by the power of God, of
regaining its original. The object of Christianity is to restore it.
The gospel, it is true, exhibits man in a state of degradation and
impotence, but as placed between two glories and two grandeurs,&mdash;a
past glory, from which he has been precipitated, and a future
glory, to which he is called. This is the truth, and man knows it
to be the truth; and how little soever he thinks of it, he easily discovers
that all which is told him of his actual purity, power, and
glory, is only a lie, designed to cradle his pride and rock it asleep.</p>

<p>Luther, in his theses, attacked not only the pretended goodness
of man's will, but also the pretended light of his understanding in
regard to divine things. In fact, scholasticism had exalted reason
as well as the will. This theology, in the hands of some of its
teachers, was, at bottom, only a species of rationalism. The propositions
which we have enumerated indicate this; for they look as
if directed against the rationalism of our own day. In the theses,
which were the signal of the Reformation, Luther attacked the
Church and the popular superstitions which to the gospel had added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
indulgences, purgatory, and numberless abuses. In those which
we have just given he attacked the school and the rationalism
which had robbed the gospel of the doctrine of the sovereignty of
God, his revelation and his grace. The Reformation attacked rationalism
before it attacked superstition. It proclaimed the rights
of God before lopping off the excrescences of man. It was positive
before it was negative. This has not been sufficiently attended to,
and yet, without attending to it, it is impossible duly to appreciate
the character of this religious revolution.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the truths which Luther thus expressed with
so much energy were quite new. To maintain these theses at Wittemberg
had been an easy matter. There his influence was paramount,
and it would have been said that he had chosen a field of
battle where he knew no combatant could appear. In offering
battle in another university he gave them a greater publicity; and
it was by publicity that the Reformation was effected. He turned
his eyes towards Erfurt, where the theologians had shown themselves
so exasperated against him.</p>

<p>He, accordingly, sent his theses to John Lange, prior of Erfurt,
and wrote him as follows: "My anxiety for the decision which you
will give as to these theses is great, extreme, too great, perhaps,
and keeps me on the rack. I much suspect that your theologians
will consider as paradoxical and <i>kakodoxical</i>,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> what I must henceforth
regard as most orthodox. Tell me how it is, and as soon as
you possibly can. Have the goodness to make known to the Faculty
of Theology, and to all, that I am ready to come and publicly
maintain these propositions either in the university or the monastery."
It does not seem that Luther's challenge was accepted.
The monks of Erfurt contented themselves with intimating that his
theses had incurred their high displeasure.</p>

<p>But he was desirous to send them to some other part of Germany;
and with that view bethought him of a man who plays an
important part in the history of the Reformation, and with whom
the reader must be made acquainted.</p>

<p>A distinguished professor, named John Meyer, was then teaching
in the university of Ingolstadt, in Bavaria. He was a native
of Eck, a village in Swabia, and was commonly called Doctor Eck.
He was a friend of Luther, who respected his talents and acquirements.
Full of intellect, he had read much, and was possessed of
a very retentive memory. To erudition he added eloquence. His
voice and gesture bespoke the vivacity of his genius. In regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
talent, Eck was in the south of Germany what Luther was in the
north. They were the two most distinguished theologians of the
period, though of very different views. Ingolstadt was almost the
rival of Wittemberg. The reputation of these two doctors attracted
crowds of eager students from all quarters to the universities
in which they taught; their personal qualities not less than
their abilities endearing them to their pupils. The character of
Doctor Eck has been assailed, but an anecdote in his history will
show that at this period, at least, his heart was not closed against
generous impressions.</p>

<p>Among the students whom his fame had attracted to Ingolstadt
was a young man, named Urban Regius, from the banks of an
Alpine lake. He had first studied at the university of Fribourg
in Brisgau. On his arrival at Ingolstadt, to which he had been
attracted by the fame of Doctor Eck, Urban engaged in his course
of philosophy, and gained the favour of his master. Requiring to
provide for his maintenance, he was under the necessity of taking
charge of some young noblemen, and had not only to superintend
their studies and their conduct, but also to purchase on his own
account whatever books and clothes they required. The youths
dressed in style, and kept a good table. Regius becoming embarrassed
prayed the parents to recall their sons. "Never fear," was
the answer. His debts increased, his creditors became pressing,
and he was at his wit's end. The emperor was raising an army
against the Turks, and a recruiting party having arrived at Ingolstadt,
Urban in despair enlisted. Clothed in military attire, he
appeared in the ranks at the time when the review took place,
previous to their departure. Doctor Eck coming up at that instant
with several of his colleagues, was greatly surprised to discover
his student among the recruits. "Urban Regius!" said he, fixing
his keen eye on him. "Here," replied the recruit. "What, pray,
is the cause of this?" The young man told his story. "I take
the matter upon myself," replied Eck, and setting his halberd
aside, bought him off from the recruiting party. The parents,
threatened by the Doctor with the displeasure of the prince, sent
the necessary funds to defray the expences of their children, and
Urban Regius was saved to become at a later period one of the
pillars of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Doctor Eck occurred to Luther as the proper person to publish
his theses on Pelagianism and scholastic rationalism in the south of
the empire. He did not, however, send them to the professor of
Ingolstadt directly, but employed a mutual friend, the excellent
Christopher Scheurl, secretary to the town of Nuremberg, praying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
him to send them to Eck at Ingolstadt, which is at no great distance
from Nuremberg. "I send you," says he, "my paradoxical,
and even kakistodoxical (&#954;&#945;&#954;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;&#962;) propositions, as many think
them. Communicate them to our dear friend, the very learned
and talented Eck, that I may learn and know what he thinks of
them."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> These were the terms in which Luther then spoke of
Doctor Eck; such was the friendship then subsisting between them.
It was not Luther who broke it off.</p>

<p>Ingolstadt, however, was not the field on which the battle was
to be fought. The doctrines on which these theses turned were
perhaps of greater importance than those which, two months after,
set the Church in a blaze; and yet, notwithstanding of Luther's
challenges, they passed unnoticed. At most, they were read within
the circle of the school, and produced no sensation beyond it.
The reason was, because they were only university propositions
and theological doctrines, whereas the subsequent theses related
to an evil which had grown up in the midst of the people, and was
then causing devastation in all parts of Germany. So long as
Luther was contented with reviving forgotten doctrines, all was
silence; but when he attacked abuses which were universally felt,
every one turned to listen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all that Luther proposed in either case was to
produce one of those theological discussions which were then so
common in universities. To this circle his views were confined.
He was humble, and his humility amounted even to distrust and
anxiety. "Considering my ignorance," said he, "all I deserve is
to be hid in a corner, without being known by any one under the
sun."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But a mighty hand drew him out of this corner in which
he wished to remain unknown to the world. A circumstance, independent
of Luther's will, threw him into the field of battle, and
the war commenced. This providential circumstance we are now
called upon to relate.</p>

<h2>BOOK THIRD.</h2>

<h2>CHAP. I.</h2>

<h3>THE INDULGENCES AND THESES.</h3>

<p class="center">1517, 1518.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Cortège&mdash;Tezel&mdash;Tezel's Discourse&mdash;Confession&mdash;Four Graces&mdash;Sale&mdash;Public Penance&mdash;A
Letter of Indulgence&mdash;Exceptions&mdash;Feasting and Debauchery.</p></blockquote>


<p>At this period the people of Germany were all in motion. The
Church had opened a vast market on the earth. From the crowd
of customers, and the noise and pleasantry of the sellers, one would
have thought it a fair, only a fair held by monks. The merchandise
which they were showing off, and selling a bargain, was, as
they said, the salvation of souls.</p>

<p>The merchants travelled the country in a fine carriage, accompanied
by three mounted attendants, journeying in grand style,
and living at great expence. One would have said it was some
high Mightiness with his suite and officers, and not a vulgar dealer
or mendicant monk. When the cortège approached a town, a
messenger was despatched to the magistrate to say, "The grace
of God and of St. Peter is at your gates." Immediately the whole
place was in motion. Clergy, priests, nuns, the council, school-masters
and their scholars, the incorporations with their colours,
men and women, old and young, went out to meet the merchant
with lighted tapers in their hand, amid the sound of music and the
ringing of bells, "insomuch," says a historian, "that God himself
could not have been received with greater honour." After the
formalities were over the whole body proceeded to the church.
The Bull of Grace by the pontiff was carried in front, on a velvet
cushion or cloth of gold. Next came the chief of the indulgence
merchants, carrying a large wooden cross, painted red.
The whole procession moved forward, amid hymns, prayers, and
the smoke of incense. The merchant monk and his attendants
were received at the church by the pealing organ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
thrilling music. The cross was placed in front of the altar, and
over it the pope's arms were suspended. All the time it remained
there the clergy of the place, the penitentiaries and sub-commissaries,
came each day after vespers or before the <i>salute</i>,
to do obeisance to it with white wands in their hands.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> This
grand affair produced a lively sensation in the quiet cities of Germany.</p>

<p>At these sales one personage in particular drew the attention
of the spectators. It was he who carried the great red cross, and
played the principal character. He was clothed in the dress of a
Dominican, and had an arrogant air. His voice was Stentorian,
and though in his sixty-third year,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> he seemed still in full vigour.
This man, the son of one Diez, a jeweller of Leipsic, was called
John Diezel, or Tezel. He had studied in his native town, became
bachelor in 1487, and two years after entered the Dominican
order. Numerous honours had accumulated on his head.
Bachelor in theology, prior of the dominicans, apostolic commissary,
inquisitor, <i>hæreticæ pravitatis inquisitor</i>, he had discharged
the office of commissary of indulgences, without intermission,
from 1502. The skill which he had acquired as subaltern
soon raised him to the office of commissary-in-chief. He had
eighty florins a month, and all his expences paid, together with a
carriage and three horses; but his perquisites (it is easy to comprehend
what they were) far exceeded his salary. In 1507 at
Freiberg he gained two thousand florins in two days. If he discharged
the functions, he had also the manners of a quack. Convicted
of adultery and shameful misconduct at Inspruck, his vices
had almost cost him his life. The Emperor Maximilian had ordered
him to be put into a sack and thrown into the river; but
the Elector Frederick happening to arrive, obtained his pardon.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
The lesson which he thus received had not given him more modesty;
for he had two of his children along with him.</p>

<p>Miltitz, the pope's legate, mentions the fact in one of his letters.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
It would have been difficult to find in all the cloisters of Germany
a man better fitted for the traffic with which he was entrusted.
To the theology of a monk, to the zeal and temper of an
inquisitor, he united the greatest effrontery; but the thing which,
above all, made the task easy to him, was his skill in inventing
extraordinary stories to captivate the minds of the people. To
him all means were good that filled his coffers. Raising his voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and giving free vent to his vulgar eloquence, he offered his indulgences
to every comer, and knew better than any dealer at a fair how
to set off his merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>After the cross was erected, and the arms of the pope suspended
over it, Tezel mounted the pulpit, and with a tone of assurance
began to extol the value of the indulgences in presence of the
crowd who had been attracted to the church by the ceremony.
The people listened and stared on hearing the wondrous virtues of
which he told them. A Jesuit historian, speaking of the Dominicans
with whom Tezel was associated, says, "Some of these
preachers failed not, as usual, to outrage the subject which they
treated, and so to exaggerate the value of the indulgences as to
make people suppose they were certain of their own salvation, and
of the deliverance of souls from purgatory as soon as the money
was paid."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> If such were the scholars, we may judge what the
master was. Let us listen to one of his harangues after setting
up the cross.</p>

<p>"Indulgences are the most precious and most sublime gift of
God.</p>

<p>"This cross (pointing to the red cross) has the very same efficacy
as the actual cross of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>"Come, and I will give you letters under seal, by which even
the sins which you may have a desire to commit in future will all
be forgiven.</p>

<p>"I would not exchange my privileges for that of St. Peter in
heaven; for I have saved more souls by my indulgences than the
apostle by his sermons.</p>

<p>"There is no sin too great for an indulgence to remit; and even
should any one (the thing, no doubt, is impossible) have done violence
to the Holy Virgin Mary, mother of God, let him pay, let him
only pay well, and it will be forgiven him.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>"Think, then, that for each mortal sin you must, after confession
and contrition, do penance for seven years, either in this life
or in purgatory. Now, how many mortal sins are committed in
one day, in one week? How many in a month, a year, a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
life?<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Ah! these sins are almost innumerable, and innumerable
sufferings must be endured for them in purgatory. And now, by
means of these letters of indulgence, you can at once, for life, in
all cases except four, which are reserved to the Apostolic See, and
afterwards at the hour of death, obtain a full remission of all your
pains and all your sins."</p>

<p>Tezel even made financial calculations on the subject.</p>

<p>"Do you not know," said he, "that when a man proposes to go
to Rome, or to any other country where travellers are exposed to
danger, he sends his money to the bank, and for every five hundred
florins that he means to have, gives five, or six at most, in
order that, by means of letters from the bank, he may receive the
money safely at Rome or elsewhere.... And, you, for the fourth
of a florin, will not receive these letters of indulgence, by means of
which you might introduce into the land of paradise, not worthless
money, but a divine and immortal soul, without exposing it to the
smallest risk."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Tezel next passed to another subject.</p>

<p>"But more than this," said he; "indulgences not only save the
living: they also save the dead.</p>

<p>"For this repentance is not even necessary.</p>

<p>"Priest! noble! merchant! wife! young girls! young men!
hear your departed parents and your other friends, crying to
you from the bottom of the abyss, 'We are enduring horrible torments!
A little alms would deliver us; you can give it, and yet
will not!'"</p>

<p>These words, uttered by the formidable voice of the charlatan
monk, made his hearers shudder.</p>

<p>"At the very instant," continued Tezel, "when the piece of
money chinks on the bottom of the strong box, the soul comes out
of purgatory, and, set free, flies upward into heaven."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>"O imbecile and brutish people, who perceive not the grace
which is so richly offered to you!... Now heaven is everywhere
open!... Do you refuse at this hour to enter? When, then, will
you enter? Now you can ransom so many souls! Hard-hearted
and thoughtless man, with twelve pence you can deliver your father
out of purgatory, and you are ungrateful enough not to save him!
I will be justified on the day of judgment, but you, you will be
punished so much the more severely, for having neglected so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
salvation. I declare to you, that though you had only a single
coat, you would be bound to take it off and sell it, in order to obtain
this grace.... The Lord our God is no longer God. He has
committed all power to the pope."</p>

<p>Then, trying to avail himself of other weapons still, he added,
"Know you why our most holy Lord is distributing so great a
grace? His object is to raise up the ruined church of St. Peter
and St. Paul, so that it may not have its equal in the universe.
That church contains the bodies of the holy apostles St. Peter and
St. Paul, and of a multitude of martyrs. Owing to the actual state of
the building, these holy bodies are now, alas! beaten, flooded,
soiled, dishonoured, and reduced to rottenness, by the rain and
the hail.... Ah! are these sacred ashes to remain longer in
mud and disgrace?"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>This picture failed not to make an impression on many who felt
a burning desire to go to the help of poor Leo X, who had not
wherewith to shelter the bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul from the
rain.</p>

<p>Then the orator opened on the arguers and traitors who opposed
his work. "I declare them excommunicated," exclaimed he.</p>

<p>Afterwards addressing docile souls, and making a profane use
of Scripture, "Happy are the eyes which see what you see; for I
tell you, that many prophets and many kings have desired to see
the things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear
the things which you hear, and have not heard them." And at
last, showing the strong box in which the money was received, he
usually concluded his pathetic discourse with this triple appeal to
the people, "Bring! bring! bring!" "These words," says Luther,
"he uttered with such horrible bellowing, that one might have
thought it was a mad bull making a rush at people, and striking
them with his horns."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> When his discourse was ended, he came
down from the pulpit, ran towards the chest, and in presence of the
people chucked a piece of money into it, taking care to make it give
a very loud tinkle.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Such were the discourses which astonished Germany, heard in
the days when God was preparing Luther.</p>

<p>At the termination of the discourse, the indulgence was understood
"to have established its throne in the place in due form."
Confessionals were set up adorned with the pope's arms. The sub-commissaries,
and the confessors whom they selected, were considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to represent the apostolical penitentiaries of Rome at the
jubilee, and on each of these confessionals were posted, in large
characters, their names, surnames, and designations.</p>

<p>Then a crowd pressed forward to the confessor, each coming with
a piece of money in his hand. Men, women, and children, the poor,
even those who lived on alms, all found means of procuring money.
The penitentiaries, after having anew explained the greatness of
the indulgence to each individual, asked, "How much money can
you afford to part with, in order to obtain so complete a forgiveness?"
"This question," says the Instruction of the Archbishop
of Mentz to the commissaries; "this question ought to be put at
this moment, that the penitents may thereby be the better disposed
to contribute."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Four valuable graces were promised to those who aided in building
the basilisk of St. Peter. "The first grace which we announce
to you," said the commissaries, according to their Letter of Instruction,
"is the complete pardon of all sins."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> After this came three
other graces,&mdash;<i>first</i>, the right of choosing a confessor, who, whenever
the hour of death should seem to be at hand, would give absolution
from all sins, and even from the greatest crimes reserved
for the Apostolic See;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> <i>second</i>, a participation in all the blessings,
works, and merits of the Catholic Church, in prayers, fastings,
alms, and pilgrimages; and, <i>third</i>, the redemption of the souls
which are in purgatory.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>To obtain the first of these graces, it was necessary to have contrition
of heart and confession of the lips, or, at least, the intention
of confessing. But for the three others, they could be obtained
without contrition or confession, merely by paying. Previous to
this, Christopher Columbus, extolling the value of gold, had said
quite gravely, "He who possesses it may introduce souls into paradise."
Such was the doctrine taught by the Archbishop-Cardinal of
Mentz, and the commissaries of the pope. "As to those," said they,
"who would deliver souls from purgatory, and procure for them pardon
of all their offences, let them throw money into the chest. It
is not necessary for them to have contrition of the heart or confession
of the lips.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Let them only hasten with their money; for
they will thus do a work most useful to the souls of the departed,
and to the erection of the Church of St. Peter." Greater blessings
could not be offered at a cheaper rate.</p>

<p>When the confession was over, and it did not take long, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
faithful hastened towards the seller. One only had charge of the
sale, and kept his counter near the cross. He carefully eyed those
who approached him, examining their air, bearing, and dress, and
asked a sum proportioned to the appearance which each presented.
Kings, queens, princes, archbishops, bishops, were, according to
the regulation, to pay twenty-five ducats for an ordinary indulgence.
Abbots, counts, and barons, paid ten. Others of the
nobility, rectors, and all who had an income of five hundred florins,
paid six. Those who had two hundred florins a-year paid one;
others, only a half. Moreover, when the tax could not be followed
to the letter, full powers were given to the commissary-apostolic,
who was to arrange everything in accordance with the dictates of
"sound reason," and the generosity of the donor.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> For particular
sins, Tezel had a particular tax. Polygamy paid six ducats;
theft in a church, and perjury, nine ducats; murder, eight ducats;
magic, two ducats. Samson, who carried on the same traffic in
Switzerland as Tezel in Germany, had a somewhat different tax.
For infanticide he charged four livres <i>tournois</i>; for parricide or
fratricide, a ducat.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The apostolic commissaries sometimes encountered difficulties in
carrying on their trade. It often happened, both in towns and
villages, that husbands were opposed to the whole concern, and
prohibited their wives from giving any thing to these merchants.
What, then, were devout spouses to do? "Have you not your
dowry, or some other property, at your own disposal?" asked the
dealers. "In that case we may dispose of part for so sacred a purpose,
even against the will of your husbands."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>The hand which had given the indulgence could not receive the
money. This was prohibited under the severest penalties; for there
might be good reason to suspect that that hand would not have
been faithful. The penitent himself behoved to deposit the price
of his pardon in the chest.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Angry looks were given to those who
were audacious enough not to open their purses.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>If among those who pressed forward to the confessionals, there
happened to be any one whose crime was publicly known, though
of a kind which the civil law could not reach, he behoved, first of
all, to do public penance. For this purpose they first led him to
a chapel or sacristy, where they stripped him of his clothes, and
took off his shoes, leaving him nothing but his shirt. His arms
were crossed upon his breast, a light placed in one hand, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
rod in the other. Then the penitent walked at the head of the procession
which proceeded to the red cross. He remained on his
knees till the chant and the collect was finished. Then the commissary
gave out the Psalm, <i>Miserere mei</i>. The confessors immediately
approached the penitent, and led him across the church
towards the commissary, who, taking the rod from his hand, and
gently striking him thrice on the back with it,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> said to him, "The
Lord have pity on thee, and forgive thy sin." He then gave out
the <i>Kyrie Eleison</i>. The penitent was led back to the front of the
cross, and the confessor gave him the apostolic absolution, and
declared him restored to the company of the faithful. Sad mummery,
concluded with a holy expression, which, at such a moment,
was mere profanation!</p>

<p>It is worth while to know the contents of one of those diplomas
of absolution which led to the Reformation of the Church. The
following is a specimen:&mdash;"May our Lord Jesus Christ have pity
on thee, N. N., and absolve thee by the merit of his most holy
passion. And I, in virtue of the apostolic power entrusted to me,
absolve thee from all ecclesiastical censures, judgments, and penalties,
which thou mayest have deserved; moreover, from all the
excesses, sins, and crimes, which thou mayest have committed,
how great and enormous soever they may have been, and for whatever
cause, even should they have been reserved to our most holy
Father the pope, and to the apostolic see. I efface all the marks
of disability, and all the notes of infamy which thou mayest have
incurred on this occasion. I remit the pains which thou shouldest
have to endure in purgatory. I render thee anew a partaker in the
sacraments of the church. I again incorporate thee into the communion
of saints, and re-establish thee in the innocence and purity
in which thou wert at the hour of thy baptism; so that, at the moment
of thy death, the gate of entrance to the place of pains and
torments will be shut to thee, and, on the contrary, the gate which
leads to the heavenly paradise, will be opened to thee. If thou art
not to die soon, this grace will remain unimpaired till thy last hour
arrive. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

<p>"Friar John Tezel, commissary, has signed it with his own
hand."</p>

<p>How dexterously presumptuous and lying words are here intermingled
with holy Christian expressions!</p>

<p>All the faithful required to come and confess at the place where
the red cross was erected. The only exceptions were the sick, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
aged, and pregnant women. If, however, there happened to be in
the neighbourhood some noble in his castle, or some great personage
in his palace, there was an exemption for him;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> for he might
not care to mingle with the crowd, and his money was worth the
going for.</p>

<p>If there happened to be a convent whose heads were opposed to
the traffic of Tezel, and prohibited their monks from visiting the
places where the indulgence had erected its throne, means were still
found to remedy the evil by sending them confessors, who were
commissioned to absolve them against the will of their order and
the will of their heads.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> There was not a vein in the mine, however
small, which they did not find means of working.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at the object and end of the whole affair,
the summing up of the cash. For greater security, the strong box
had three keys&mdash;one in the hands of Tezel, the second in those of
the treasurer, appointed by the firm of Fugger of Augsburg, who
had been appointed agents in this vast enterprise, while the third
was entrusted to the civil authority. When the moment arrived,
the counters were opened in the presence of a notary-public, and
the whole was duly counted and recorded. Must not Christ arise
and drive these profane sellers from the temple?</p>

<p>The mission being closed, the dealers relaxed from their labours.
It is true the instructions of the commissary-general forbade them
to frequent taverns and suspicious places;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> but they cared little for
this prohibition. Sin must have appeared a very trivial matter to
people who had such an easy trade in it. "The mendicants," says
a Roman Catholic historian, "led a bad life, expending in taverns,
gaming-houses, and places of infamy, what the people retrenched
from their necessities."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> It is even averred, that in taverns they
sometimes played at dice for the salvation of souls.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>But let us look at some of the scenes which then took place in
Germany during this sale of the pardon of sins; for we here meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with anecdotes which, by themselves alone, give a picture of the
times. As we proceed with our narrative we deem it best to let
men speak for themselves.</p>

<p>At Magdebourg Tezel refused to absolve a wealthy female, unless
she would pay him one hundred florins in advance. She consulted
her ordinary confessor, who was a Franciscan. "God,"
replied he, "gives the remission of sins freely, and does not sell
it." However, he begged her not to tell Tezel what advice he
had given her. But the merchant having somehow or other heard
of words so injurious to his interest, exclaimed, "Such an adviser
deserves to be banished or burned."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Tezel rarely found men enlightened enough, and still more
rarely men bold enough, to resist him. For the most part he had
a good market from the superstitious crowd. He had erected the
red cross of indulgences at Zwickau, and the good parishioners had
hastened to make the money which was to deliver them chink on
the bottom of the chest. He was going away with a well-filled
purse. The evening before his departure the chaplains and their
attendants applied to him for a farewell entertainment. The request
was reasonable; but how was it possible to comply with it?
the money was already counted and sealed up. The next morning
he orders the large bell to be rung. Crowds hastened to
the church, every one thinking that something extraordinary must
have happened, as the station was closed. "I had resolved,"
said he, "to depart this morning, but last night was awoke by
groans. On listening I found they came from the burying-ground.
Alas! it was a poor soul calling and entreating me instantly to
deliver it from the torment by which it was consumed. I have,
therefore, remained one day more, in order to stir up the compassion
of Christian hearts in favour of this unhappy soul. I am willing
myself to be the first to give, and whosoever does not follow
my example will deserve damnation." What heart would not
have responded to such an appeal? Who knew, moreover, whose
soul it was that was crying in the burying-ground? The people
contributed freely, and Tezel gave the chaplains and their attendants
a jovial entertainment, defraying the expence by the offerings
which he had received in favour of the soul of Zwickau.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The indulgence merchants had fixed their station at Hagenau
in 1517. A shoemaker's wife, taking advantage of the authority
of the instruction of the commissary-general, had, contrary to the
will of her husband, procured a letter of indulgence, and paid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
gold florin for it. She died shortly after. The husband not having
caused mass to be said for the repose of her soul, the curate
charged him with contempt of religion, and the judge of Hagenau
summoned him to appear. The shoemaker put his wife's indulgence
in his pocket and repaired to the court. "Is your wife
dead?" asked the judge. "Yes," replied he. "What have you
done for her?" "I have buried her body, and commended her
soul to God." "But have you caused a mass to be said for the
salvation of her soul?" I have not; it was unnecessary. She
entered heaven the moment of her death." "How do you know
that?" "Here is the proof." So saying, he takes the indulgence
out of his pocket, and the judge, in presence of the curate, reads
in as many words that the woman who received it would not
enter purgatory, but go straight to heaven. "If the reverend
curate maintains that a mass is still necessary, my wife has been
cheated by our most holy father the pope. If she was not cheated,
then it is the reverend curate who is cheating me." This was unanswerable,
and the accused was acquitted. Thus the good sense
of the people did justice to these pious frauds.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>One day when Tezel was preaching at Leipsic, and introducing
into his sermons some of those stories of which we have given a
sample, two students feeling quite indignant, rose up and left the
church, exclaiming, "It is impossible for us to listen longer to the
drolleries and puerilities of this monk."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> One of them, it is said,
was young Camerarius, afterwards the intimate friend of Melancthon,
and his biographer.</p>

<p>But of all the young men of the period, he on whom Tezel made
the strongest impression unquestionably was Myconius, afterwards
celebrated as a Reformer, and historian of the Reformation.
He had received a Christian education. His father, a pious
man of Franconia, was wont to say to him, "My son, pray
frequently, for all things are freely given to us by God alone.
The blood of Christ," added he, "is the only ransom for the sins
of the whole world. O, my son! were there only three men that
could be saved by the blood of Christ, believe, and believe with
confidence, that thou art one of the three. It is an insult to the
blood of the Saviour to doubt if it saves."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Then cautioning his
son against the traffic which was beginning to be established in
Germany&mdash;"The Roman indulgences," said he to him, "are nets
which fish for money, and deceive the simple. The forgiveness of
sins and of eternal life are not things for sale."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
At the age of thirteen Frederick Myconius was sent to the
school of Annaberg to finish his studies. Shortly after, Tezel arrived
in the town, and remained in it for two years. The people
flocked in crowds to his sermon. "There is no other method,"
exclaimed Tezel in his voice of thunder; "there is no other
method of obtaining eternal life than the satisfaction of works;
but this satisfaction is impossible for man, and, therefore, all he
can do is to purchase it from the Roman pontiff."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> When Tezel
was about to quit Annaberg, his addresses became more urgent.
"Soon," exclaimed he, in a threatening tone, "soon will I take
down the cross, shut the gate of heaven,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and quench the lustre
of that sun of grace which is now shining in your eyes." Then
resuming the gentle accent of persuasion, "Now," said he, "is the
accepted time, now is the day of salvation." Then raising his
voice anew, the pontifical Stentor,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> who was addressing the inhabitants
of a rich mineral district, loudly exclaimed, "Bring your
money, burghers of Annaberg, contribute largely in behalf of the
indulgences, and your mines and your mountains will be filled with
pure silver." In conclusion, he declared that at Pentecost he
would distribute his letters to the poor gratuitously, and for the
love of God.</p>

<p>Young Myconius being among the number of Tezel's hearers,
felt an eager desire to avail himself of this offer. Going up to the
commissaries, he said to them in Latin, "I am a poor sinner, and
need a gratuitous pardon!" The merchants replied, "Those alone
can have part in the merits of Jesus Christ who lend a helping
hand to the Church, in other words, who give money." "What
is the meaning then," said Myconius, "of those promises of free
gift, which are posted up on the walls and doors of the churches?"
"Give at least a shilling," said Tezel's people who had gone to
their master, and interceded with him for the young man, but
without effect. "I am not able." "Only Sixpence." "I have
not even so much." The dominicans then began to fear that he
wished to entrap them. "Listen," said they to him, "we will
make you a present of the sixpence." The young man, raising his
voice in indignation, answered, "I want no indulgences that are
purchased. If I wished to purchase, I would only have to sell
one of my school-books. I want a free pardon, given purely for
the love of God, and you will have to give account to God for
having allowed the salvation of a soul to be lost for a sixpence."
"Who sent you to entrap us?" exclaimed the merchants. "Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but the desire of receiving the grace of God could have
tempted me to appear before such mighty lords," replied the
young man, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"I was much grieved," said he, "at being sent thus pitilessly
away; but I still felt within myself a Comforter, who told me that
there was a God in heaven, who, without money and without price,
pardons repenting sinners for the love of his Son Jesus Christ. As
I was taking leave of those people, I melted into tears, and, sobbing,
prayed, 'O God! since these men have refused me the
forgiveness of my sins, because I had no money to pay for it, do
thou, O Lord, have pity on me, and forgive my sins in pure mercy!'
I went to my lodging, and taking up my crucifix, which was lying
on my desk, laid it on my chair, and prostrated myself before it.
I cannot describe what I felt. I asked God to be my Father, and
to do with me whatsoever he pleased. I felt my nature changed,
converted, and transformed. What formerly delighted me now
excited my disgust. To live with God, and please him, was my
strongest, my only desire."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Thus Tezel himself contributed to
the Reformation. By crying abuses he paved the way for a purer
doctrine, and the indignation which he excited in a generous
youth was one day to break forth mightily. We may judge of this
by the following anecdote.</p>

<p>A Saxon gentleman, who had heard Tezel at Leipsic, felt his
indignation aroused by his falsehoods, and going up to the monk,
asked him whether he had power to pardon the sins which were intended
to be committed? "Assuredly," replied Tezel. "I have full
power from the pope to do so." "Well then," resumed the knight,
"there is one of my enemies on whom I should like to take a slight
revenge without doing him any deadly injury, and I will give you
ten crowns in return for a letter of indulgence, which will completely
acquit me." Tezel made some objections; at last, however,
they came to an agreement for thirty crowns. Soon after
the monk quits Leipsic. The gentleman accompanied by his servants,
waited for him in a wood between Jüterboch and Treblin,
and rushing out upon him, and giving him some blows with a
stick, carried off the rich indulgence chest, which the inquisitor
had with him. Tezel cries out robbery, and carries his complaint
before the judges, but the gentleman shows the letter with Tezel's
own signature, exempting him beforehand from all punishment.
Duke George, who had at first been very angry, on seeing the
document ordered the accused to be acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>This traffic everywhere occupied men's thoughts, and was everywhere
talked of. It was the subject of conversation in castles,
in academies, and at the firesides of the citizens, as well as in
inns and taverns, and all places of public resort.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Opinions were
divided, some believing, and others expressing indignation. The
sensible portion of the community rejected the whole system of
indulgences with disgust. It was so contrary to Scripture and
to morality, that all who had any knowledge of the Bible, or any
natural light, condemned it in their hearts, and only waited for a
signal to declare their opposition to it. On the other hand, scoffers
found ample materials for raillery. The people, who had for
many years been irritated by the misconduct of the priests, and
whom nothing but the fear of punishment induced to keep up a
certain show of respect, gave free vent to their hatred. Complaints
and sarcasms were everywhere heard on the avarice of the
clergy.</p>

<p>Nor did they stop here. They even attacked the power of the
keys, and the authority of the sovereign pontiff. "Why," said
they, "does not the pope deliver all souls from purgatory at once
from a holy charity, and in consideration of the sad misery of
these souls, seeing he delivers so great a number for the love of
perishable money, and of the cathedral of St. Peter? Why do
feasts and anniversaries of the dead continue to be celebrated?
Why does not the pope restore or allow others to resume the benefices
and prebends which have been founded in favour of the dead,
since it is now useless, and even reprehensible, to pray for those
whom indulgences have for ever delivered?" "What kind of new
holiness in God and the pope is this&mdash;from a love of money to
enable a wicked profane man to deliver a pious soul beloved of the
Lord from purgatory, rather than deliver it themselves gratuitously
from love, and because of its great wretchedness."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The gross and immoral conduct of the traffickers in indulgences
was much talked of. "In paying carriers for transporting them
with their goods, the innkeepers with whom they lodge, or any
one who does any piece of work for them, they give a letter of
indulgence for four, five, or any number of souls, as the case may
be." In this way, the diplomas of salvation were current in inns
and in markets like bank bills or paper money. "Bring! Bring!"
said the common people, "is the head, the belly, the tail, and the
whole body of the sermon."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>A miner of Schneeberg, meeting a seller of indulgences, asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
"Must we indeed give credit to what you have often said of the
power of the indulgence, and of the authority of the pope, and believe
it possible, by throwing a penny into the box, to ransom a
soul from purgatory?" The merchant assured him it was true.
"Ah!" resumed the miner, "what an unmerciful man the pope must
be, for a paltry penny to leave a miserable soul so long crying in
the flames. If he has no ready money, let him borrow some hundred
thousand crowns, and deliver all these people at once. We
poor folks will willingly pay him both the interest and the capital."
Thus Germany was weary of the shameful traffic which
was going on in the midst of her, and could no longer tolerate the
impostures of these master-swindlers of Rome, as Luther calls
them.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Yet no bishop, no theologian, durst oppose their quackery
and their fraud. The minds of men were in suspense, and asked
whether God would not raise up some mighty man for the work
which required to be done? This man nowhere appeared.</p>

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Leo X&mdash;Necessities of the Pope&mdash;Albert&mdash;His Character&mdash;Favours the Indulgences&mdash;The
Franciscans and the Dominicans.</p></blockquote>


<p>The pope then on the pontifical throne was not a Borgia but
Leo X, of the illustrious house of Medici. He was able, frank,
kind, and gentle. His address was affable, his liberality without
bounds, and his morals, superior to those of his court. Cardinal
Pallavicini, however, acknowledges that they were not altogether
irreproachable. To this amiable character he joined several of the
qualities of a great prince. He showed himself friendly to science
and art. The first Italian comedies were represented in his presence;
and there are few of his day which he did not see performed.
He was passionately fond of music. Musical instruments
resounded every day in his palace; and he was often heard
humming the airs which had been performed before him. He
was fond of magnificence, and spared nothing when fêtes, games,
theatricals, presents or rewards, were in question. No court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
surpassed that of the sovereign pontiff in splendour and gayety.
Accordingly, when it was learned that Julian Medicis was proposing
to reside at Rome with his young bride, "God be praised,"
exclaimed Cardinal Bibliena, the most influential counsellor of Leo
X, "the only thing we wanted was a female court."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> A female
court was necessary to complete the court of the pope. To religious
sentiment Leo was completely a stranger. "His manners
were so pleasing," says Sarpi, "that he would have been perfect
if he had had some acquaintance with religious matters, and been
somewhat more inclined to piety, which seldom, if ever, gave him
any concern."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Leo was greatly in want of money. He had to provide for his
immense expenditure, supply all his liberalities, fill the purse
of gold which he daily threw to the people, keep up the licentious
exhibitions of the Vatican, satisfy the numerous demands
of his relations and voluptuous courtiers, give a dowry to his
sister, who had been married to Prince Cibo, a natural son of
Pope Innocent VIII, and meet the expenditure occasioned by his
taste for literature, arts, and pleasure. His cousin, Cardinal
Pucci, as skilful in the art of hoarding as Leo in that of lavishing,
advised him to have recourse to indulgences. Accordingly, the
pope published a bull, announcing a general indulgence, the proceeds
of which were, he said, to be employed in the erection of
the church of St. Peter, that monument of sacerdotal magnificence.
In a letter, dated at Rome, under the seal of the Fisherman, in
November, 1517, Leo applies to his commissary of indulgences for
one hundred and forty-seven gold ducats, to pay a manuscript of
the thirty-third book of Livy. Of all the uses to which he put
the money of the Germans, this was, doubtless, the best. Still
it was strange to deliver souls from purgatory in order to purchase
a manuscript history of the wars of the Roman people.</p>

<p>There was at this time in Germany a young prince who might
be regarded as in many respects a living image of Leo X. This
was Albert, a younger brother of the elector, Joachim of Brandenburg.
At twenty-four years of age he had been appointed Archbishop
and Elector of Mentz and of Magdeburg, and two years
after made a cardinal. Albert had neither the virtues nor the
vices which are often met with in the high dignitaries of the
church. Young, fickle, worldly, but not without some generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
feelings, he was perfectly aware of many of the abuses of Catholicism,
and cared little for the fanatical monks by whom he was
surrounded. His equity disposed him, in part at least, to acknowledge
the justice of what the friends of the gospel demanded. In
his secret heart he was not much opposed to Luther. Capito,
one of the most distinguished Reformers, was long his chaplain,
counsellor, and confidant. Albert regularly attended his sermons.
"He did not despise the gospel," says Capito; "on the contrary,
he highly esteemed it, and for a long time would not allow the
monks to attack Luther." But he would have liked Luther not
to compromise him, and to take good care while exposing the
doctrinal errors and vices of the inferior clergy, not to disclose the
faults of bishops and princes. In particular, he was most anxious
that his name should not be mixed up with the affair. His confidant,
Capito, who had imposed upon himself, as men often do in
situations similar to his, thus addressed Luther: "Look to the example
of Jesus Christ and the apostles; they rebuked the Pharisees
and the incestuous man of Corinth, but they never expressly
named them. You know not what is passing in the hearts of the
bishops; and, perhaps, there is more good in them than you suppose."
But the fickle and profane spirit of Albert, still more than
the susceptibilities and fears of his self-love, estranged him from
the Reformation. Affable, clever, handsome, extravagant, and
wasteful, delighting in the pleasures of the table, in rich equipages,
splendid buildings, licentious pleasures, and literary society,
this young Archbishop-Elector was in Germany what Leo X
was at Rome. His court was one of the most magnificent in the
empire, and he was prepared to sacrifice to pleasure and grandeur
all the sentiments of truth which, perhaps, might have insinuated
themselves into his heart. Nevertheless, his better convictions
continued even to the last to exercise some degree of influence
over him, and he repeatedly gave indications of moderation and
equity.</p>

<p>Albert, like Leo, was in want of money. The Fuggers, rich
merchants in Augsburg, had made him advances which he behoved
to repay, and hence, though he had managed to secure two
archbishoprics and a bishopric, he was unable to pay Rome
for his Pallium. This ornament of white wool, bespangled with
black crosses and blessed by the pope, who sent it to the archbishops
as a token of their dignity, cost them twenty-six, or, some
say, thirty thousand florins. In order to obtain money, Albert,
naturally enough, bethought himself of having recourse to the
same methods as the pope. He accordingly applied to him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the general farming of the indulgences, or, as they expressed it at
Rome, "of the sins of the Germans."</p>

<p>The popes sometimes kept the indulgences in their own hands,
and at other times farmed them out, in the same way as some governments
still do gaming-houses. Albert made an offer to Leo
to share the profit with him, and Leo, in agreeing to the bargain,
stipulated for immediate payment of the Pallium. Albert had been
counting on paying it out of the indulgences, and therefore applied
anew to the Fuggers, who, thinking the security good, agreed, on
certain conditions, to make the advance required, and were appointed
bankers to the concern. They were the bankers of the princes
of this period, and were afterwards made counts in return for the
services which they had rendered.</p>

<p>The pope and the archbishop having thus, by anticipation, shared
in the spoils of the good souls of Germany, the next matter was to
select the persons who were to carry the affair into effect. It was
first offered to the Franciscan order, whose guardian was conjoined
with Albert. But, as it was already in bad odour with honest people,
these monks were not anxious to have anything to do with it.
The Augustins, who were more enlightened than the other religious
orders, would have been less inclined to undertake it. The Franciscans,
however, being afraid of offending the pope, who had just
sent their chief, De, Forli, a cardinal's hat, a hat which had cost
this poor mendicant order thirty thousand florins, the guardian
deemed it more prudent not to refuse openly, but, at the same
time, threw all sorts of difficulties in Albert's way. They could
never understand each other, and, accordingly, when the proposal
was made to the Elector to undertake the whole charge, he eagerly
closed with it. The Dominicans, on the other hand, longed for a
share in the general collection which was about to commence.
Tezel, who was already famous in the trade, hastened to Mentz to
offer his services to the Elector. In consideration of the talent
which he had displayed in publishing the indulgences for the
knights of the Teutonic order of Prussia and Livonia, his proposals
were accepted, and in this way, the whole traffic passed into the
hands of his order.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<h2>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Tezel approaches&mdash;Luther at the Confessional&mdash;Tezel's Rage&mdash;Luther without a
Plan&mdash;Jealousy among the Orders&mdash;Luther's Discourse&mdash;The Elector's Dream.</p></blockquote>


<p>In so far as we know, Luther heard of Tezel, for the first time,
at Grimma, in 1516, when he was on the eve of beginning his visit
to the churches. While Staupitz was still with Luther, it was
told him that an indulgence merchant was making a great noise
at Vürzen. Even some of his extravagant sayings were quoted.
Luther's indignation was roused, and he exclaimed, "Please God,
I'll make a hole in his drum."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Tezel, on his return from Berlin, where he had met with a most
friendly reception from the elector Joachim, brother of the farmer-general,
took up his head-quarters at Juterboch. Staupitz, availing
himself of his influence with the elector Frederick, had often
represented to him the abuses of the indulgences, and the scandalous
proceedings of the mendicants,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and the princes of Saxony feeling
indignant at the shameful traffic, had forbidden the merchant to
enter their territory. He was, accordingly, obliged to remain on
those of the Archbishop of Magdeburg, but at the same time came
as near to Saxony as he could, Juterboch being only four miles
from Wittemberg. "This great thresher of purses," says Luther,
"set about threshing<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> the country in grand style, so that the
money began to leap, tumble, and tinkle, in his chest." The people
of Wittemberg went in crowds to the indulgence market of
Juterboch.</p>

<p>At this period Luther had the highest respect for the church and
for the pope. "I was then," said he, "a monk, a most bigoted
Papist, so intoxicated and imbued with the doctrines of Rome, that
if I had been able I would willingly have lent a hand in killing any
one audacious enough to refuse obedience to the pope in the minutest
matter.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> I was a real Saul, as many still are." But, at the
same time, his heart was ready to declare in favour of all that he
believed to be truth, and against all that he believed to be error.
"I was a young doctor just of the irons, ardent and rejoicing in the
word of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>One day when Luther had taken his seat in the confessional at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Wittemberg, several citizens of the town came before him, and one
after another confessed the grossest immoralities. Adultery, libertinism,
usury, ill-gotten wealth, were the crimes with which the
minister of the word was entertained by persons of whose souls he
was one day to give account. He rebukes, corrects, and instructs
them; but what is his astonishment when these people tell him that
they don't choose to abandon their sins?... Quite amazed,
the pious monk declares, that since they refuse to promise amendment,
he cannot give them absolution. The wretched creatures
then appealed to their letters of indulgence, exhibiting them and
extolling their virtues. But Luther replied, that he cared little for
the paper which they had shown him, and added, <i>unless you repent</i>,
<i>you will all perish</i>. They made an outcry, and expostulated, but
the doctor was immovable; "they must cease to do evil, and learn
to do well, ... otherwise no absolution." "Beware," added he,
"of lending an ear to the harangues of the venders of indulgences;
you might be better employed than in buying those licences which
are sold you for the most paltry sum."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Much alarmed, these inhabitants of Wittemberg hastened back
to Tezel to tell him how his letters were disregarded by an Augustin
monk. Tezel, on hearing this, became red with fury, crying, and
stamping, and cursing in the pulpit.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> To strike a deeper terror
into the people, he repeatedly kindled a fire in the market-place,
declaring he had received orders from the pope to burn all heretics
who should dare to oppose his holy indulgences.</p>

<p>Such is the circumstance, which was not the cause, but the first
occasion of the Reformation. A pastor seeing the sheep of his flock
in a path which must lead them to destruction, makes an effort to
deliver them. As yet, he has no thought of reforming the church
and the world. He has seen Rome and its corruptions, but he declares
not against Rome. He perceives some of the abuses under
which Christianity is groaning, but has no thought of correcting
these abuses. He has no desire to become Reformer.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> He has
no plan for the reformation of the Church any more than he had
had one for himself. God intends reform, and for reform selects
Luther. The same remedy which had proved so powerful in curing
his own wretchedness, the hand of God will employ by him to cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the miseries of Christendom. He remains quiet in the sphere
which is assigned to him, walking merely where his Master calls
him, and fulfilling his duties as professor, preacher, and pastor, at
Wittemberg. While seated in the church, his hearers come and
open their hearts to him. Evil makes an assault upon him, and
error seeks him out, of her own accord. He is interfered with in
the discharge of his duty, and his conscience, which is bound to the
word of God, resists. Is it not God that calls him? To resist is a
duty, and being a duty, is also a right. He has no alternative but
to speak. In this way were events ordered by that God who was
pleased, says Mathesius, "to restore Christendom by means of the
son of a forge master, and to purify the impure doctrine of the
church, by making it pass through his furnaces.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Having given this detail, it must be unnecessary to refute a false
imputation invented by some of Luther's enemies, but not till after
his death. Jealousy for his order, it has been said, grief at seeing
a shameful and condemned traffic entrusted to the Dominicans in
preference to the Augustins, who had hitherto enjoyed it, led the
doctor of Wittemberg to attack Tezel and his doctrines. The well
known fact that this traffic was first offered to the Augustins, who
refused it, is sufficient to refute this fable, which has been repeated
by writers who have copied each other; even Cardinal Pallavicini
states that the Augustins never had discharged this office.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Besides,
we have seen the travail of Luther's soul. His conduct
needs no other explanation. It was impossible for him not to
make open profession of the doctrine to which he owed his happiness.
In Christianity, every man who finds a blessing longs to
make others partakers in it. In our day it is time to abandon
those puerile explanations which are unworthy of the great revolution
of the sixteenth century. To lift a world, a more powerful
lever was required. The Reformation existed not in Luther only;
it was the offspring of his age.</p>

<p>Luther impelled equally by obedience to the truth of God, and
by charity towards men, mounted the pulpit. He forewarned his
hearers; but, as he himself says, he did it gently.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> His prince had
obtained particular indulgences from the pope for the church of the
castle of Wittemberg, and it was possible that some of the blows
which he was going to level at the indulgences in question might
fall on those of the Elector. No matter; he will run the risk. If
he sought to please men, he would not be the servant of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
"No man can prove by Scripture," says the faithful minister of
the Word to the people of Wittemberg, "that the justice of God
exacts a penalty or satisfaction from the sinner; the only duty
which it imposes upon him is true repentance, sincere conversion,
a resolution to bear the cross of Jesus Christ, and to be diligent in
good works. It is a great error to think we can ourselves satisfy
the justice of God for our sins. He always pardons them gratuitously
by his inestimable grace.</p>

<p>"The Christian Church, it is true, requires something from the
sinner, and consequently has the power of remitting what she so
requires, but that is all. Even these indulgences of the Church are
tolerated, only on account of indolent and imperfect Christians, who
will not zealously exercise themselves in good works. For they
stimulate none to sanctification, but leave all in imperfection."</p>

<p>Then adverting to the pretext under which the indulgences were
published, he continues:&mdash;"It would be much better to contribute
to the erection of St. Peter's church from love to God, than to
purchase indulgences in this view.... But you ask, Are we then
never to purchase them? I have already said, and I repeat it;
my advice is, Don't purchase. Leave them to sleepy Christians,
but do you walk apart in your own path. The faithful must be
diverted from indulgences, and urged to do the works which they
neglect."</p>

<p>At last, glancing at his adversaries, Luther concludes thus:&mdash;"If
some cry out that I am a heretic, (for the truth which I preach
is very hurtful to their strong box,) their clamour gives me little
concern. They are dull and sickly brains, men who never felt the
Bible, never read Christian doctrine, never comprehended their
own teachers, and who turn to rottenness, wrapped up in the
tatters of their vain opinions,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> ... God grant them and us a
sound mind. Amen." After these words, the doctor descended
from the pulpit, leaving his hearers in astonishment at his bold
language.</p>

<p>This sermon was printed, and made a deep impression on all
who read it. Tezel answered it, and Luther replied; but these
discussions did not take place till a later period, (1518).</p>

<p>The feast of All Saints drew near. The chronicles of that day
here relate a circumstance, which, though not important to the history
of the period, may, however, serve to characterise it. It is a
dream of the Elector, which in substance is unquestionably authentic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
though several circumstances may have been added by those who
have related it. It is mentioned by Seckendorf,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> who observes,
that the fear of giving their adversaries ground to say that the
doctrine of Luther was founded upon dreams, has perhaps prevented
several historians from speaking of it.</p>

<p>The Elector Frederick of Saxony, say the chronicles of the time,
was at his castle of Schweinitz, six leagues from Wittemberg. On
the morning of the 31st October, being in company with his brother
Duke John, who was then co-regent, and became sole elector after
his death, and with his chancellor, the Elector said to the Duke,</p>

<p>"Brother, I must tell you a dream which I had last night, and
the meaning of which I should like much to know. It is so deeply
impressed on my mind, that I will never forget it, were I to live a
thousand years. For I dreamed it thrice, and each time with new
circumstances."</p>

<p><i>Duke John.</i>&mdash;"Is it a good or a bad dream?"</p>

<p><i>The Elector.</i>&mdash;"I know not; God knows."</p>

<p><i>Duke John.</i>&mdash;"Don't be uneasy at it; but be so good as tell it
to me."</p>

<p><i>The Elector.</i>&mdash;"Having gone to bed last night, fatigued and out
of spirits, I fell asleep shortly after my prayer, and slept quietly
for about two hours and a half; I then awoke, and continued awake
till midnight, all sorts of thoughts passing through my mind.
Among other things, I thought how I was to observe the feast of
All Saints. I prayed for the poor souls in purgatory, and supplicated
God to guide me, my counsels, and my people, according
to truth. I again fell asleep, and then dreamed that Almighty
God sent me a monk, who was a true son of the Apostle Paul.
All the saints accompanied him by order of God, in order to bear
testimony before me, and to declare that he did not come to contrive
any plot, but that all that he did was according to the will of
God. They asked me to have the goodness graciously to permit
him to write something on the door of the church of the castle of
Wittemberg. This I granted through my chancellor. Thereupon
the monk went to the church, and began to write in such large
characters, that I could read the writing at Schweinitz. The pen
which he used was so large that its end reached as far as Rome,
where it pierced the ears of a lion that was couching there,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and
caused the triple crown upon the head of the pope to shake. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the cardinals and princes running hastily up, tried to prevent it
from falling. You and I, brother, wished also to assist, and I
stretched out my arm ... but at this moment I awoke, with my
arm in the air, quite amazed, and very much enraged at the monk
for not managing his pen better. I recollected myself a little: it
was only a dream.</p>

<p>"I was still half asleep, and once more closed my eyes. The
dream returned. The lion, still annoyed by the pen, began to roar
with all his might, so much so that the whole city of Rome and all
the states of the holy empire, ran to see what the matter was. The
pope requested them to oppose this monk, and applied particularly
to me, on account of his being in my country. I again awoke,
repeated the Lord's Prayer, entreated God to preserve his Holiness,
and once more fell asleep.</p>

<p>"Then I dreamed that all the princes of the empire, and we
among them, hastened to Rome, and strove one after another to
break the pen; but the more we tried the stiffer it became, sounding
as if it had been made of iron. We at length desisted. I
then asked the monk (for I was sometimes at Rome and sometimes
at Wittemberg) where he got this pen, and why it was so strong.
'The pen,' replied he, 'belonged to an old goose of Bohemia, a
hundred years old.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> I got it from one of my old school-masters.
As to its strength, it is owing to the impossibility of depriving it of
its pith or marrow, and I am quite astonished at it myself.' Suddenly
I heard a loud noise; a large number of other pens had
sprung out of the long pen of the monk.... I awoke a third
time; it was daylight...."</p>

<p><i>Duke John.</i>&mdash;"Chancellor, what is your opinion? Would we
had a Joseph or a Daniel enlightened by God!"</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i>&mdash;"Your Highnesses know the common proverb, that
the dreams of young girls, learned men, and great lords, have usually
some hidden meaning. The meaning of this dream, however, we
will not be able to know for some time; not till the things to which
it relates have taken place. Wherefore, leave the accomplishment
to God, and place it wholly in his hand."</p>

<p><i>Duke John.</i>&mdash;"I am of your opinion, Chancellor; 'tis not fit for
us to annoy ourselves in attempting to discover the meaning; the
God will overrule all for his glory."</p>

<p><i>Elector.</i>&mdash;"May our faithful God do so; yet I will never forget
this dream. I have indeed thought of an interpretation, but I
keep it to myself. Time, perhaps, will show if I have been a good
diviner."</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Feast of All Saints&mdash;The Theses&mdash;Their Force&mdash;Moderation&mdash;Providence&mdash;Letter
to Albert&mdash;Indifference of the Bishops&mdash;Dissemination of the Theses.</p></blockquote>


<p>The words of Luther had produced little effect. Tezel, without
troubling himself, continued his traffic and his impious harangues.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
Will Luther submit to these crying abuses, and keep silence? As
a pastor, he has earnestly exhorted those who have had recourse to
his ministry, and, as a preacher, he has lifted his warning voice in
the pulpit. It still remains for him to speak as a theologian&mdash;to
address, not individuals in the confessional, not the assembly of
the faithful in the church of Wittemberg, but all who, like himself,
are teachers of the word of God. His resolution is taken.</p>

<p>He has no thought of attacking the Church, or of putting the pope
on his defence. On the contrary, it is his respect for the pope that
will not allow him to be any longer silent with regard to claims by
which he is injured. He must take the part of the pope against
audacious men, who dare to associate his venerable name with
their disgraceful traffic. Far from thinking of a revolution which
is to destroy the primacy of Rome, Luther expects to have the
pope and Catholicism for his allies against impudent monks.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>The feast of All Saints was an important day for Wittemberg,
and especially for the church which the Elector had there erected
and filled with relics. On that day these relics, adorned with silver
and gold, and precious stones, were brought out and exhibited to
the eyes of the people, who were astonished and dazzled by their
magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Whoever on that day visited the church and confessed
in it obtained a valuable indulgence. Accordingly, on this
great occasion, pilgrims came in crowds to Wittemberg.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
On the 31st of October, 1517, Luther, who had already taken his
resolution, walks boldly towards the church to which the superstitious
crowds of pilgrims were repairing, and puts up on the door of
this church ninety-five Theses or propositions against the doctrine
of indulgences. Neither the Elector, nor Staupitz, nor Spalatin,
nor any, even the most intimate of his friends, had been previously
informed of this step.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> In these theses, Luther declares, in a kind
of preamble, that he had written them with the express desire of
setting the truth in the full light of day. He declares himself ready
to defend them on the morrow at the university, against all and
sundry. The attention which they excite is great; they are read
and repeated. In a short time the pilgrims, the university, the
whole town is ringing with them. The following are some of these
Propositions, written with the pen of the monk, and fixed on the
door of the church of Wittemberg.</p>

<p>1. "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ says 'repent,' he
means that the whole life of his followers on the earth is a constant
and continual repentance.</p>

<p>2. "This expression cannot be understood of the sacrament of
penitence, (that is to say, of confession and satisfaction,) as administered
by the priest.</p>

<p>3. "Still the Lord intends not to speak merely of internal repentance.
Internal repentance is null, if it does not manifest itself
externally by the mortification of the flesh.</p>

<p>4. "Repentance and sorrow&mdash;that is to say, true penitence&mdash;continue
so long as a man is displeased with himself&mdash;that is, until
he passes from this life into life eternal.</p>

<p>5. "The pope is not able, and does not wish to remit any other
penalty than that which he has imposed of his own good pleasure,
or conformably to the canons, that is to say, the papal ordinances.</p>

<p>6. "The pope cannot remit any condemnation, but only declare
and confirm the remission which God himself has given. At least
he can only do it in cases which belong to him. If he does otherwise,
the condemnation remains exactly as before.</p>

<p>8. "The laws of ecclesiastical penance ought to be imposed on
the living only, and have nothing to do with the dead.</p>

<p>21. "The commissaries of indulgence are mistaken when they say
that the pope's indulgence delivers from all punishment and saves.</p>

<p>25. "The same power which the pope has over purgatory throughout
the Church, each bishop has individually in his own diocese,
and each curate in his own parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>27. "It is the preaching of human folly to pretend, that at the
very moment when the money tinkles in the strong box, the soul
flies off from purgatory.</p>

<p>28. "This much is certain; as soon as the money tinkles,
avarice and the love of gain arrive, increase, and multiply. But
the aids and prayers of the Church depend only on the will and
good pleasure of God.</p>

<p>32. "Those who imagine they are sure of salvation by means
of indulgences will go to the devil, with those who teach them so.</p>

<p>35. "It is an antichristian doctrine to pretend, that, in order to
deliver a soul from purgatory, or to purchase an indulgence, there
is no need of either sorrow or repentance.</p>

<p>36. "Every Christian who truly repents of his sins has entire
forgiveness of the penalty and the fault, and, so far, has no need
of indulgence.</p>

<p>37. "Every true Christian, dead or alive, participates in all
the blessings of Christ and of the Church by the gift of God and
without a letter of indulgence.</p>

<p>38. "Still the dispensation and pardon of the pope must not
be despised; for his pardon is a declaration of the pardon of God.</p>

<p>40. "Genuine sorrow and repentance seek and love punishment;
but the mildness of indulgence takes off the fear of punishment,
and begets hatred against it.</p>

<p>42. "Christians must be told that the pope has no wish and
no intention that they should in any respect compare the act of
purchasing indulgences with any work of mercy.</p>

<p>43. "Christians must be told that he who gives to the poor, or
lends to the needy, does better than he who buys an indulgence:</p>

<p>44. "For the work of charity makes charity increase, and renders
a man more pious; whereas the indulgence does not make
him better, but only gives him more self-confidence, and makes
him more secure against punishment.</p>

<p>45. "Christians must be told that he who sees his neighbour
want, and, instead of helping him, purchases an indulgence, purchases
not the indulgence of the pope, but incurs the Divine displeasure.</p>

<p>46. "Christians must be told that if they have no superfluity,
they are bound to keep what they have, in order to procure necessaries
for their families, and not to lavish it on indulgences.</p>

<p>47. "Christians must be told that to purchase an indulgence is
optional, not obligatory.</p>

<p>48. "Christians must be told that the pope having more need
of prayer offered up in faith than of money, desires the prayer
more than the money when he dispenses indulgences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>49. "Christians must be told that the indulgence of the pope is
good provided they do not place their confidence in it, but that
nothing is more hurtful if it diminishes piety.</p>

<p>50. "Christians must be told that if the pope knew of the extortions
of the preachers of indulgences, he would rather that the
metropolis of St. Peter were burned and reduced to ashes, than see
it built with the skin, flesh, and bones, of his sheep.</p>

<p>51. "Christians must be told that the pope, as is his duty, would
dispense his own money to the poor people whom the preachers of
indulgences are now robbing of their last penny, were he, for that
purpose, even to sell the metropolis of St. Peter.</p>

<p>52. "To hope to be saved by indulgences is an empty and lying
hope even should the commissary of indulgences, nay, the pope
himself, be pleased to pledge his own soul in security of it.</p>

<p>53. "Those who, on account of the preaching of indulgences,
forbid the preaching of the word of God, are enemies of the pope
and of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>55. "The pope cannot have any other thought than this:&mdash;If
the indulgence, which is the lesser matter, is celebrated with
bell, pomp, and ceremony, it is necessary, <i>à fortiori</i>, to honour
and celebrate the gospel, which is the greater matter, with a
hundred bells, a hundred pomps, and a hundred ceremonies.</p>

<p>62. "The true and precious treasure of the Church is the holy
gospel of the glory and grace of God.</p>

<p>65. "The treasures of the gospel are nets, which once caught
the rich, and those who were at ease in their circumstances:</p>

<p>66. "But the treasures of indulgence are nets, in which, now-a-days,
they catch, not rich people, but the riches of people.</p>

<p>67. "It is the duty of bishops and pastors to receive the commissaries
of apostolic indulgences with all respect:</p>

<p>68. "But it is still more their duty to use their eyes and their
ears, in order to see that the said commissaries do not preach the
dreams of their own imaginations instead of the orders of the pope.</p>

<p>71. "Cursed be he who speaketh against the indulgence of the
pope.</p>

<p>72. "But blessed be he who speaks against the foolish and impudent
words of the preachers of indulgences.</p>

<p>76. "The indulgence of the pope cannot take away the smallest
daily sin, in regard to the fault or delinquency.</p>

<p>79. "To say that a cross adorned with the arms of the pope is
as powerful as the cross of Christ is blasphemy.</p>

<p>80. "Bishops, pastors, and theologians, who allow such things
to be said to the people, will be called to account for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>81. "This shameful preaching, these impudent eulogiums on
indulgences make it difficult for the learned to defend the dignity
and honour of the pope against the calumnies of the preachers, and
the subtile and puzzling questions of the common people.</p>

<p>86. "Why, say they, does not the pope, whose wealth is greater
than that of rich Cr&oelig;sus, build the metropolis of St. Peter with
his own money rather than with that of poor Christians?</p>

<p>92. "Would, then, that we were discumbered of all the preachers
who say to the church of Christ, Peace! Peace! when there
is no peace!</p>

<p>94. "Christians should be exhorted to diligence in following
Christ their head through crosses, death, and hell.</p>

<p>95. "For it is far better to enter the kingdom of heaven through
much tribulation, than to acquire a carnal security by the flattery
of a false peace."</p>

<p>Here, then, was the commencement of the work. The germ
of the Reformation was contained in these theses of Luther. The
abuses of indulgence were attacked in them, (and this was
their most striking feature,) but behind those attacks there was,
moreover, a principle which although it attracted the attention of
the multitude far less, was destined one day to overthrow the
edifice of the papacy. The evangelical doctrine of a free and gratuitous
remission of sins was here publicly professed for the first
time. Henceforth the work must grow. In fact, it was evident
that any man who had faith in the remission of sins as preached
by the doctor of Wittemberg; any one who had this conversion and
sanctification, the necessity of which, he urged, would no longer
concern himself about human ordinances, but would escape from
the swaddling-bands of Rome, and secure the liberty of the children
of God. All errors behoved to give way before this truth.
By it light had at first entered Luther's own mind, and by it, in
like manner, light is to be diffused in the Church. What previous
reformers wanted was a clear knowledge of this truth; and hence
the unfruitfulness of their labours. Luther himself was afterwards
aware that, in proclaiming justification by faith, he had
laid the axe to the root of the tree. "This is the doctrine," said
he, "which we attack in the followers of the papacy. Huss and
Wickliff only attacked their lives, but in attacking their doctrine,
we take the goose by the neck. All depends on the Word which
the pope took from us and falsified. I have vanquished the pope,
because my doctrine is according to God, and his is according to
the devil.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
We too have in our day forgotten the capital doctrine of justification
by faith, though, in a sense, the reverse of that of our
fathers. "In the time of Luther," says one of our contemporaries,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
"the remission of sins at least cost money, but in our
day every one supplies himself gratis." These two extremes
are very much alike. Perhaps there is even more forgetfulness
of God in our extreme, than in that of the sixteenth century.
The principle of justification by the grace of God, which brought
the Church out of so much darkness at the time of the Reformation,
is also the only principle which can renew our generation,
put an end to its doubts and waverings, destroy the canker of
egotism, establish the reign of morality and justice, and, in one word
reunite the world to God, from whom it has been separated.</p>

<p>But if the theses of Luther were mighty in virtue of the truth
which they proclaimed, they were not less so through the faith of
their declared defender. He had boldly unsheathed the sword of
the Word, and he had done it trusting to the power of truth.
He had felt, that in leaning on the promises of God he could, in
the language of the world, afford to risk something. Speaking of
this bold attack, he says, "Let him who would begin a good
enterprise undertake it, trusting to its own merits, and not (of this
let him beware) to the help and countenance of man. Moreover,
let not men, nor even the whole world, deter him. For these
words will never deceive:&mdash;'It is good to trust in the Lord; and
none that trust in him shall be confounded.' But let him who
neither is able nor willing to hazard something through trust in
God, beware of undertaking any thing."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Doubtless, Luther, after
putting up his theses on the door of the church of All Saints, retired
to his tranquil cell, in full possession of the peace and joy
imparted by an action done in the name of the Lord, and for the
sake of eternal truth.</p>

<p>These theses, notwithstanding of their great boldness, still bespeak
the monk, who refuses to allow a single doubt as to the
authority of the See of Rome. But in attacking the doctrine of
indulgences, Luther had, without perceiving it, assailed several
errors, the exposure of which could not be agreeable to the pope,
seeing that they tended, sooner or later, to bring his supremacy
in question. Luther, at the time, did not see so far; but he
felt all the boldness of the step which he had just taken, and,
consequently, thought himself bound to temper it in so far as was
consistent with the respect due to truth. He, accordingly, presented
his theses only as doubtful propositions on which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
anxious for the views of the learned; and, conformably to the
established custom, annexed to them a solemn protestation, declaring
that he wished not to say or affirm any thing not founded
on Holy Scripture, the Fathers of the Church, and the rights and
decretals of the See of Rome.</p>

<p>Often, in the sequel, on contemplating the immense and unlooked-for
consequences of this courageous attack, Luther was
astonished at himself, and could not understand how he had ventured
upon it. An invisible hand, mightier than his own, held
the leading reins, and pushed him into a path which he knew
not, and from the difficulties of which he would, perhaps, have
recoiled, if he had known them, and been advancing alone and
of himself. "I engaged in this dispute," says he, "without
premeditated purpose, without knowing it or wishing it; and was
taken quite unprepared. For the truth of this I appeal to the
Searcher of hearts."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Luther had become acquainted with the source of these abuses.
He had received a little book, ornamented with the arms of the
Archbishop of Mentz and Magdeburg, and containing the regulations
to be observed in the sale of indulgences. It was this
young prelate, therefore, this accomplished prince, who had
prescribed, or at least sanctioned, all this quackery. In him
Luther only sees a superior to whom he owes fear and reverence;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
and wishing not to beat the air, but to address those entrusted
with the government of the Church, he sends him a letter, distinguished
at once by its frankness and humility. Luther wrote
this letter to Albert the same day on which he put up his theses.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, most reverend Father in Christ, and most illustrious
Prince," says he to him, "if I, who am only the dregs of
mankind,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> have the presumption to write your High Mightiness.
The Lord Jesus is my witness, that, feeling how small and despicable
I am, I have long put off doing it.... Will your Highness,
however, be pleased to let fall a look on a grain of dust,
and, in accordance with your episcopal meekness, graciously receive
my petition.</p>

<p>"There are people who are carrying the papal indulgence up
and down the country in the name of your Grace. I do not so
much blame the declamation of the preachers, (I have not heard
them,) as the erroneous ideas of unlearned and simple people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
who imagine that by buying indulgences they secure their salvation....</p>

<p>"Good God! souls entrusted to your care, most venerable Father,
are conducted to death, and not to life. The just and strict
account which will be required of you grows and augments from
day to day.... I have not been able to continue longer silent.
Ah! man is not saved by works, or by the performances of his
bishop.... Even the righteous scarcely is saved; and the way
that leadeth unto life is strait. Why, then, do the preachers of
indulgences by vain fables inspire the people with a false security?</p>

<p>"According to them, indulgence alone ought to be proclaimed,
ought to be extolled.... What! Is it not the chief and only duty
of bishops to instruct the people in the gospel and the love of
Jesus Christ?<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Jesus Christ has nowhere ordered the preaching
of indulgence; but has strongly enjoined the preaching of the
gospel.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> How dreadful, then and how perilous, for a bishop to
allow the gospel to be passed in silence, and nothing but the
sound of indulgence to be incessantly dunned into the ears of his
people....</p>

<p>"Most worthy Father in God, in the Instruction of the commissaries,
which has been published in name of your Grace, (doubtless
without your knowledge,) it is said that the indulgence is the
most precious treasure,&mdash;that it reconciles man to God, and enables
those who purchase it to dispense with repentance.</p>

<p>"What then, can I, what ought I to do, most venerable Bishop,
most serene Prince? Ah! I supplicate your Highness, by the
Lord Jesus Christ, to turn upon this business an eye of paternal
vigilance, to suppress the pamphlet entirely, and ordain preachers
to deliver a different sort of discourses to the people. If you decline
to do so, be assured you will one day hear some voice raised
in refutation of these preachers, to the great dishonour of your
most serene Highness."</p>

<p>Luther at the same time sent his theses to the archbishop, and, in
a postscript, asked him to read them, that he might be convinced
how little foundation there was for the doctrine of indulgences.</p>

<p>Thus Luther's whole desire was, that the watchmen of the
Church should awake, and exert themselves in putting an end to
the evils which were laying it waste. Nothing could be more
noble and more respectful than this letter from a monk to one of
the greatest princes of the Church and the empire. Never was
there a better exemplification of the spirit of our Saviour's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
precept&mdash;"Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and
unto God the things which are God's." This is not the course of
violent revolutionists, who contemn powers and blame dignities.
It is a cry proceeding from the conscience of a Christian and a
priest, who gives honour to all, but in the first place fears God.
However, all prayers and supplications were useless. Young
Albert, engrossed by his pleasures and ambitious designs, made
no reply to this solemn appeal. The Bishop of Brandebourg,
Luther's ordinary&mdash;a learned and pious man, to whom, also, he
sent his theses&mdash;replied that he was attacking the power of the
Church, that he would involve himself in great trouble and vexation,
that the thing was beyond his strength, and that his earnest
advice to him was to keep quiet.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The princes of the Church
shut their ears against the voice of God, thus energetically and
affectingly declared by the instrumentality of Luther. They would
not comprehend the signs of the times; they were struck with
that blindness which has been the ruin of so many powers and
dignities. "Both thought," says Luther afterwards, "that the
pope would be too many for a miserable mendicant like me."</p>

<p>But Luther was better able than the bishops to perceive the
disastrous effects which the indulgences had upon the manners
and lives of the people; for he was in direct correspondence with
them. He had constantly a near view of what the bishops learned
only by unfaithful reports. If the bishops failed him, God did not
fail him. The Head of the Church, who sits in heaven, and to
whom has been given all power upon the earth, had himself prepared
the ground, and deposited the grain in the hands of his servant.
He gave wings to the seed of truth, and sent it in an instant
over the whole length and breadth of his Church.</p>

<p>Nobody appeared at the university next day to attack the propositions
of Luther. The traffic of Tezel was too much in discredit,
and too disgraceful for any other than himself, or some one of his
creatures, to dare to take up the gauntlet. But these theses were
destined to be heard in other places than under the roof of an
academical hall. Scarcely had they been nailed to the door of
the castle church of Wittemberg, than the feeble strokes of the
hammer were followed throughout Germany by a blow which
reached even to the foundations of proud Rome, threatening sudden
ruin to the walls, the gates, and the pillars of the papacy,
stunning and terrifying its champions, and at the same time
awakening thousands from the sleep of error.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
These theses spread with the rapidity of lightning. A month
had not elapsed before they were at Rome. "In a fortnight,"
says a contemporary historian,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> "they were in every part of
Germany, and in four weeks had traversed almost the whole of
Christendom; as if the angels themselves had been the messengers,
and carried them before the eyes of all men. Nobody can believe
what a noise they made." They were afterwards translated into
Dutch and Spanish, and a traveller even sold them at Jerusalem.
"Every one," says Luther, "was complaining of the indulgences;
and as all the bishops and doctors had kept silence, and nobody
had ventured to bell the cat, poor Luther became a famous doctor,
because, as they expressed it, one had at length come who dared
to do it. But I liked not this glory; the music seemed to me too
lofty for the words."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Some of the pilgrims, who had flocked from different countries
to Wittemberg for the feast of All Saints, instead of indulgences
carried home with them the famous theses of the Augustin
monk, and thus helped to circulate them. All read, pondered,
and commented on them. They occupied the attention of all convents
and all universities.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> All pious monks who had entered the
cloister to save their soul, all upright and honest men, rejoiced in
this striking and simple confession of the truth, and wished with
all their heart that Luther would continue the work which he had
begun. At length a monk had had the courage to undertake this
perilous contest. It was a reparation made to Christendom, and
the public conscience was satisfied. In these theses piety saw a
blow given to all kinds of superstition; the new theology hailed
in them the defeat of the scholastic dogmas; princes and magistrates
regarded them as a barrier raised against the encroachments
of ecclesiastical power; while the nations were delighted at
seeing the decided negative which this monk had given to the
avarice of the Roman chancery. Erasmus, a man very worthy of
credit, and one of the principal rivals of the Reformer, says to
Duke George of Saxony, "When Luther attacked this fable, the
whole world concurred in applauding him." "I observe," said he
on another occasion to Cardinal Campeggi, "that those of the
purest morals, and an evangelical piety, are the least opposed to
Luther. His life is lauded even by those who cannot bear his
faith. The world was weary of a doctrine containing so many
childish fables, and was thirsting for that living water, pure and
hidden, which issues from the springs of the evangelists and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
apostles. The genius of Luther was fitted to accomplish these
things, and his zeal must have animated him to the noble enterprise."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>We must follow these propositions wherever they penetrated; to
the studies of the learned, the cells of monks, and the palaces of
princes, in order to form some idea of the various but wonderful
effects which they produced in Germany.</p>

<p>Reuchlin received them. He was weary of the hard battle
which he had been obliged to fight against the monks. The
power which the new combatant displayed in his theses revived
the spirit of the old champion of letters, and gave joy to his saddened
heart. "Thanks be to God," exclaimed he, after he had
read them, "now they have found a man who will give them so
much to do, that they will be obliged to let me end my old age in
peace."</p>

<p>The prudent Erasmus was in the Netherlands when the theses
reached him. He was inwardly delighted at seeing his secret
wishes for the reformation of abuses expressed with so much
boldness, and commended their author, only exhorting him to
more moderation and prudence. Nevertheless, some persons in
his presence blaming Luther's violence, he said, "God has given
men a cure which cuts thus deep into the flesh, because otherwise
the disease would be incurable." And at a later period when the
Elector of Saxony asked his opinion as to Luther's affair, he replied
with a smile, "I am not at all astonished at his having
made so much noise, for he has committed two unpardonable
faults; he has attacked the tiara of the pope and the belly of the
monks."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Flek, prior of the cloister of Steinlausitz, had for some time
given up reading mass, but had not told any one his reason.
He one day found the theses of Luther posted up in the refectory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his convent. He went up and began to read them, but had only
perused a few, when unable to contain his joy, he exclaimed,
"Well, well, he whom we have been so long looking for is come
at last; and this you monks will see." Then reading in the future,
says Mathesius, and playing upon the word Wittemberg, he
said, "Everybody will come to seek wisdom at this mountain, and
will find it.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> He wrote to the doctor to persevere courageously
in his glorious combat. Luther calls him a man full of joy and
consolation.</p>

<p>The ancient and celebrated episcopal see of Würzburg was then
held by Lowrence de Bibra, a man, according to the testimony
of his contemporaries, pious, honest, and wise. When a gentleman
came to intimate to him that he intended his daughter for the
cloister, "Give her rather a husband," said he; and then added,
"Are you in want of money for that purpose? I will lend you."
The emperor and all the princes held him in the highest esteem.
He lamented the disorders of the Church, and especially those of
convents. The theses having reached his palace also, he read
them with great delight, and publicly declared his approbation of
Luther. At a later period he wrote to the Elector Frederick,
"Don't part with pious Dr. Martin Luther; for he has been
wronged." The Elector delighted at this testimony, wrote the
Reformer with his own hand to acquaint him with it.</p>

<p>The Emperor Maximilian, predecessor of Charles V, also read
and admired the theses of the monk of Wittemberg. He perceived
his talents, and foresaw that this obscure Augustin might,
indeed, become a powerful ally of Germany in her struggle with
Rome. Accordingly, he instructed his envoy to say to the Elector
of Saxony, "Take good care of the monk Luther, for the time
may come when we shall have need of him;"<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> and shortly after,
being at a diet with Pfeffinger, the Elector's confidential councillor,
he said to him, "Well what is your Augustin doing? Assuredly
his propositions are not to be despised; he will give the
monks enough to do."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>At Rome even, and in the Vatican, the theses were not so ill
received as might have been supposed. Leo X judged of them
as a friend of letters, rather than a pope. The amusement which
they gave him made him overlook the severe truths which they
contained; and when Sylvester Prierias, the master of the sacred
palace, who had the office of examining new works, urged him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
treat Luther as a heretic, he replied, "This Friar, Martin Luther,
is a great genius; all that is said against him is mere monkish
jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>There were few on whom the theses of Luther produced a
deeper impression than on the scholar of Annaberg, whom Tezel
had so pitilessly repulsed. Myconius had entered a convent, and
the very first evening dreamed he saw an immense field quite
covered with ripe corn. "Cut," said the voice of his guide to him;
and when he excused himself for want of skill, his guide showed
him a reaper, who was working with inconceivable rapidity.
"Follow, and do like him," said the guide.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Myconius, eager for
holiness as Luther had been, devoted himself when in the convent
to vigils, fasts, macerations, and all the works invented by men;
but at length he despaired of ever attaining the objects of his efforts.
He abandoned study, and spent his whole time in manual
labour. Sometimes he bound books, sometimes used the turning-lathe,
and sometimes did any other kind of work. Still, however,
this external labour did not appease his troubled conscience.
God had spoken to him, and he could not fall back into his former
slumber. This state of agony lasted for several years. It is
sometimes supposed that the paths of the Reformers were quite
smooth, and that after they renounced the observances of the
Church, their remaining course was easy and pleasant. It is not
considered that they arrived at the truth by means of internal
struggles, a thousand times more painful than the observances to
which servile minds easily submitted.</p>

<p>At length the year 1517 arrived. The theses of Luther were
published, and, traversing Christendom, arrived also at the convent
where the scholar of Annaberg was residing. He hid himself
in a corner of the cloister, with John Voit, another monk, that
they might be able to read them without interruption.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> They contained
the very truth of which his father had told him. His eyes
were opened, he felt a voice within him responding to that which
was then sounding throughout Germany, and great consolation
filled his heart. "I see plainly," said he, "that Martin Luther is the
reaper whom I saw in my dream, and who taught me to gather the
ears of corn." He immediately began to profess the doctrine which
Luther had proclaimed. The monks, alarmed when they heard
him, argued with him, and declaimed against Luther and against
his convent. "That convent," replied Myconius, "is like our Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sepulchre; they wish to prevent Christ from rising again, but will
not succeed." At last his superiors, seeing they could not convince
him, interdicted him for a year and a half from all intercourse with
the world, not permitting him even to write or to receive letters,
and threatening him with perpetual imprisonment. However, for
him also the hour of deliverance arrived. Being afterwards appointed
pastor at Zwickau, he was the first who declared against
the papacy in the churches of Thuringia. "Then," says he, "I
could work with my venerable father Luther at the Gospel harvest."
Jonas describes him as a man as able as he was willing.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless, there were others also to whom Luther's theses were
the signal of life. They kindled a new light in many cells, cottages,
and palaces. "While those who had entered convents in quest of
good fare and indolence, or rank and honours," says Mathesius,
"began to load the name of Luther with reproaches, the monks
who lived in prayer, fasting, and mortification, thanked God as
soon as they heard the cry of the eagle, announced by John Huss,
a century before."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Even the people who did not well understand
the theology of the question, and who only knew that Luther was
assailing the empire of mendicants and lazy monks, received it with
bursts of joy. An immense sensation was produced in Germany by
his bold propositions. However, some of the Reformer's contemporaries,
who foresaw the consequences to which they might lead,
and the numerous obstacles which they were destined to encounter,
loudly expressed their fears, or at most rejoiced with trembling.</p>

<p>"I am much afraid," wrote the excellent canon of Augsburg,
Bernard Adelman, to his friend Pirckeimer, "that the worthy man
must yield at last to the avarice and power of the partizans of indulgences.
His representations have had so little effect, that the
Bishop of Augsburg, our primate and metropolitan,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> has just ordered
new indulgences, in the name of the pope, for St. Peter's at Rome.
Let him hasten to seek the aid of princes. Let him beware of
tempting God; for it were to show an absolute want of sense to
overlook the imminent danger to which he is exposed." Adelman
was greatly delighted when it was rumoured that Henry VIII had
invited Luther to England. "There," thought he, "he will be
able to teach the truth in peace." Several thus imagined that the
doctrine of the gospel was to be supported by the power of princes,
not knowing that it advances without this power, and is often
trammelled and weakened by the possession of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
The celebrated historian, Albert Kranz, was at Hamburg on his
deathbed, when Luther's theses were brought to him. "You are
right, friar Martin," he exclaimed, "but you will not succeed....
Poor monk! Go into your cell and cry, 'Lord, have mercy on
me!'"<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>An old priest of Hexter in Westphalia, having received and read
the theses in his presbytery, said in Low German, shaking his
head, "Dear friar Martin! if you succeed in overthrowing this purgatory
and all these paper merchants, assuredly you are a mighty
segnior!" Erbenius, a century later, wrote beneath these words
the following stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quid vero nunc si viveret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bonus iste clericus diceret?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What then would the good clerk say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were he alive to see this day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not only did many of Luther's friends entertain fears as to the
step which he had taken, but several even testified their disapprobation.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Brandenburg, distressed at seeing his diocese the
scene of so important a contest, was anxious to suppress it. He
resolved to take the gentle method, and employed the Abbot of
Lenin to say to Luther, in his name, "I don't find any thing in the
theses contradictory of Catholic truth. I myself condemn these
indiscreet proclamations; but for the love of peace and deference
to your bishop, cease writing on the subject." Luther was confounded
at being thus humbly addressed by so great an abbot and
so great a bishop, and led away by the feelings of the moment, replied,
"I consent. I would rather obey than work miracles, were
it in my power."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>The Elector was grieved at the commencement of a contest which
was no doubt legitimate, but the end of which it was impossible to
foresee. No prince was more desirous than Frederick for the maintenance
of public peace. Now, what an immense fire might this
small spark not kindle? What discord, what rending of nations,
might this quarrel of monks not produce? The Elector repeatedly
made Luther aware how much he was annoyed.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Even in his own order and his own convent of Wittemberg,
Luther met with disapprobation. The prior and sub-prior, terrified
at the clamour of Tezel and his companions, repaired in fear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
trembling to the cell of friar Martin, and said, "Do not, we entreat
you, bring shame on our order. The other orders, and
especially the Dominicans, are overjoyed to think that they are
not to be alone in disgrace." Luther was moved by these words,
but soon recovering himself, he replied, "Dear fathers, if the thing
is not done in the name of God it will fail, but if it is, let it proceed."
The prior and sub-prior said no more. "The thing proceeds
even now," adds Luther, after relating this anecdote, "and,
please God, always will proceed better and better, even to the
end. Amen."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Luther had many other attacks to sustain. At Erfurt he was
accused of violence and pride in his manner of condemning the
opinions of others&mdash;the charge usually brought against those who
act under the strong conviction which the word of God gives. He
was also charged with precipitation and fickleness.</p>

<p>"They call upon me for moderation," replied Luther, "and they
themselves, in the judgment which they pass upon me, trample it
under foot!... We see the mote in our brother's eye, and observe
not the beam in our own.... Truth will no more gain by my moderation
than it will lose by my presumption. I desire to know,"
continued he, addressing Lange, "what errors you and your theologians
have found in my theses? Who knows not that a new
idea is seldom advanced without an appearance of arrogance, and
an accusation of disputatiousness? Were humility herself to undertake
something new, those of an opposite opinion would charge
her with pride.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Why were Christ and all the martyrs put to
death? Because they were deemed proud despisers of the wisdom
of the time, and advanced new truths without previously taking
counsel of the organs of ancient opinion."</p>

<p>"Let not the wise of the present day, then, expect of me humility,
or rather hypocrisy enough, to ask their opinion before publishing
what duty calls me to say. What I do will be done, not
by the prudence of men, but by the counsel of God. If the work
is of God, who can arrest it? If it is not of God, who can advance
it?... Not my will, nor theirs, nor ours, but Thy will be done,
O Holy Father who art in heaven!" In these words what courage,
what noble enthusiasm, what confidence in God, and, above
all, what truth, truth fitted to all times!</p>

<p>Still the reproaches and accusations which assailed Luther from
all quarters, failed not to make some impression on his mind.
His hopes were disappointed. He had expected to see the heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the church, and the most distinguished scholars of the nation,
publicly uniting with him; but it was otherwise. A word of approbation,
allowed to escape at the first moment of enthusiasm,
was all that the best disposed gave him, while several of those
whom he had till then most highly venerated were loud in censuring
him. He felt himself alone in the whole Church,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> alone
against Rome, alone at the foot of that ancient and formidable
edifice, whose foundations lay deep in the bowels of the
earth, whose battlements reached the clouds, and at which he had
just struck a daring blow. He was troubled and depressed.
Doubts which he thought he had surmounted returned with new
force. He trembled at the thought of having the authority of the
whole Church against him, of withdrawing from that authority
and resisting that voice which nations and ages had humbly
obeyed, of setting himself in opposition to that church which he had
from infancy been accustomed to venerate as the mother of the
faithful.... He a paltry monk ... the effort was too great for
man.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> No step cost him more than this, and, accordingly, it was
the step which decided the Reformation.</p>

<p>The struggle which took place in his soul cannot be better described
than in his own words. "I began this affair," says he,
"with great fear and trembling. Who was I, a poor, miserable,
despicable friar, liker a corpse than a living man;<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>&mdash;who was
I, to oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom not only the
kings of the earth and the whole world, but also, if I may so speak,
heaven and hell trembled, compelled to yield obedience to his
nod? Nobody can imagine what my heart suffered during those two
first years, and into what depression, I might say what despair,
I was often plunged. No idea of it can be formed by those proud
spirits who afterwards attacked the pope with great boldness, although
with all their ability they could not have done him the
least harm, had not Jesus Christ, by me his feeble and unworthy
instrument, given him a wound which never will be cured. But
while they were contented to look on, and leave me alone
in danger, I was not so joyful, so tranquil, or so sure about the
business; for at that time I did not know many things which,
thank God, I know now. It is true, several pious Christians were
much pleased with my Propositions, and set a great value upon
them, but I could not own and regard them as the organs of the
Holy Spirit. I looked only to the pope, the cardinals, bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
theologians, jurisconsults, monks, and priests. That was the direction
from which I expected the Spirit to come. Still having,
by means of Scripture, come off victorious over all contrary arguments,
I have at length, by the grace of Christ, though after
much pain, travail, and anguish, surmounted the only argument
which arrested me, viz., that it is necessary to listen to the
Church;<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> for from the bottom of my heart I honoured the church
of the pope as the true church, and did so with much more sincerity
and veneration, than those shameless and infamous corrupters
who are now so very forward in opposing me. Had I despised
the pope as much as he is despised in the hearts of those who
praise him so loudly with their lips, I would have dreaded that
the earth would instantly open and swallow me up as it did Corah
and his company!"</p>

<p>How honourable these misgivings are to Luther! How well
they display the sincerity and uprightness of his soul! And how
much more worthy of respect do those painful assaults which he
had to sustain, both within and without, prove him to be, than
mere intrepidity without any such struggle, could have done!
The travail of his soul clearly displays the truth and divinity of
his work. We see that their origin and principle were in heaven.
After all the facts which we have stated, who will presume to say
that the Reformation was an affair of politics? No, assuredly; it
was not the effect of human policy, but of the power of God. Had
Luther been urged by human passions only, he would have yielded
to his fears; his miscalculations and scruples would have
smothered the fire which had been kindled in his soul, and he would
only have thrown a transient gleam upon the Church, in the same
way as the many zealous and pious men, whose names have come
down to us. But now God's time had arrived; the work was not
to be arrested; the emancipation of the Church was to be accomplished.
Luther was destined at least to prepare that complete
emancipation and those extensive developments which are promised
to the kingdom of Christ. Accordingly, he experienced the
truth of the magnificent promise, "The strong men shall faint
and be weary, and the young men utterly fail; but they who wait
upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up
with wings like eagles." This Divine power which filled the
heart of the doctor of Wittemberg, and which had engaged him in
the combat, soon gave him back all his former resolution.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Tezel's Attack&mdash;Luther's Reply&mdash;Good Works&mdash;Luther and Spalatin&mdash;Study of
Scripture&mdash;Scheurl and Luther&mdash;Doubts on the Theses&mdash;Luther for the People&mdash;A
New Suit.</p></blockquote>


<p>The reproaches, timidity, or silence, of Luther's friends had
discouraged him; the attacks of his enemies had the very opposite
effect. This frequently happens. The adversaries of the truth,
while thinking by their violence to do their own work, often do
that of God himself.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The gauntlet which had been thrown down
was taken up by Tezel with a feeble hand. Luther's sermon,
which had been to the people what his theses had been to the
learned, was the subject of his first reply. He refuted it point by
point, in his own way, and then announced that he was preparing
to combat his adversary at greater length in theses which he would
maintain at the university of Frankfort on the Oder. "Then,"
said he, adverting to the conclusion of Luther's sermon; "then
every one will be able to judge who is heresiarch, heretic, schismatic,
erroneous, rash, and calumnious. Then will it be manifest to
the eyes of all who has a dull brain, who has never felt the Bible,
read Christian doctrines, understood his own teachers.... In
maintaining the propositions which I advance, I am ready to suffer
all things, prison, cudgel, water, and fire."</p>

<p>One thing which strikes us in reading this production of Tezel
is the difference between his German and that of Luther. One
would say that an interval of several ages is between them. A
foreigner, especially, sometimes finds it difficult to comprehend
Tezel, whereas the language of Luther is almost the same as that
of our day. A comparison of the two is sufficient to show that
Luther is the creator of the German language. No doubt, this is
one of his least merits, but still it is one.</p>

<p>Luther replied without naming Tezel; Tezel had not named
him. But there was nobody in Germany who could not have
placed at the head of their publications the name which they had
judged it expedient to suppress. Tezel tried to confound the repentance
which God demands with the penance which the Church
imposes, in order to give a higher value to his indulgences. Luther
made it his business to clear up this point.</p>

<p>"To avoid many words," said he, in his graphic style, "I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to the wind (which, besides, has more leisure than I have) his
other words, which are only sheets of paper and withered leaves;
and I content myself with examining the foundations of his house
of bur-thistle.</p>

<p>"The penitence which the holy father imposes cannot be that
which Jesus Christ demands; for whatever the holy father imposes
he can dispense with; and if these two penitences were
one and the same, it would follow that the holy father takes away
what Jesus appoints, and thereby makes void the commandment
of God.... Ah! if it so pleases him, let him maltreat me," continues
Luther, after quoting other false interpretations of Tezel;
"let him call me heretic, schismatic, calumniator, or anything
he likes; I will not on that account be his enemy, but will pray
for him as for a friend. But it is not possible to allow him to
treat the Holy Scriptures, our consolation, (Rom., xv, 4,) as a
sow treats a sack of corn."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>We must accustom ourselves to Luther's occasional use of expressions
too harsh and homely for our age,&mdash;it was the custom
of the time; and under those words which in our days would violate
the proprieties of language, there is usually a force and justice
which disposes us to pardon their rankness. He continues
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who buys indulgences, say our adversaries, does better
than he who gives alms to a poor man not absolutely in extremity.
Now, let them tell us that the Turks are profaning our
churches and crosses, we will be able to hear it without a shudder;
for we have amongst ourselves Turks a hundred times worse,
who profane and annihilate the only true sanctuary, the word of
God, which sanctifies all things.... Let him who would follow
this precept take good care not to give food to the hungry, nor
clothing to the naked, before they give up the ghost, and, consequently,
have no need of his assistance."</p>

<p>It is important to contrast the zeal which Luther thus manifests
for good works with what he says of justification by faith. Indeed,
no man who has any experience, or any knowledge of
Christianity, needs this new proof of a truth of which he is fully
assured; viz., that the more we adhere to justification by faith,
the more strongly we feel the necessity of works, and the more
diligently we practise them; whereas lax views as to the doctrine
of faith necessarily lead to laxity of conduct. Luther, as St.
Paul before, and Howard after him, are proofs of the former; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
men without faith (and with such the world is filled) are proofs
of the latter.</p>

<p>Luther comes next to the insulting language of Tezel, and pays
him back in his own way. "At the sound of these invectives
methinks I hear a large ass braying at me. I am delighted at it,
and would be very sorry that such people should give me the
name of a good Christian." We must give Luther as he is with
all his foibles. This turn for pleasantry, coarse pleasantry, was
one of them. The Reformer was a great man, undoubtedly a
man of God; but he was a man, not an angel, and not even a
perfect man. Who is entitled to call upon him for perfection?</p>

<p>"For the rest," adds he, challenging his opponents to the combat,
"although it is not usual to burn heretics for such points,
here, at Wittemberg, am I, Doctor Martin Luther! Is there any
inquisitor who pretends to chew fire, and make rocks leap into the
air? I give him to know, that he has a safe-conduct to come here,
an open door, and bed and board certain, all by the gracious care
of our admirable Duke Frederick, who will never protect heresy."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>We see that Luther was not deficient in courage. He trusted
to the word of God&mdash;a rock which never gives way in the tempest.
But God in faithfulness gave him still further aid. The
bursts of joy with which the multitude had hailed Luther's theses
were soon succeeded by a gloomy silence. The learned had timidly
drawn back on hearing the calamities and insults of Tezel
and the Dominicans. The bishops, who had previously been loud
in condemnation of the abuses of indulgences, seeing them at
length attacked, had not failed, with an inconsistency of which
there are but too many examples, to find that at that time the
attack was inopportune. The greater part of the Reformer's
friends were frightened. Several of them had fled. But when
the first terror was over, the minds of men took an opposite direction.
The monk of Wittemberg soon saw himself again surrounded
with a great number of friends and admirers.</p>

<p>There was one who, although timid, remained faithful to him
throughout this crisis, and whose friendship at once solaced and
supported him. This was Spalatin. Their correspondence was
not interrupted. "I thank you," says he, when speaking of a particular
mark of friendship which he had received from him; "but
what do I not owe you?"<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> It was on the 11th November, just
fifteen days after the publication of the theses, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when the minds of men were in a state of the greatest fermentation,
that Luther thus delights to unbosom his gratitude to his
friend.</p>

<p>In the same letter to Spalatin, it is interesting to see the strong
man, who had just performed a most daring exploit, declaring
from what source he derives his strength. "We can do nothing
of ourselves; we can do everything by the grace of God. By us
all ignorance is invincible, but no ignorance is invincible by the
grace of God. The more we endeavour of ourselves to attain to
wisdom, the nearer we approach to folly.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> It is not true that
this invincible ignorance excuses the sinner; were it so there
would be no sin in the world."</p>

<p>Luther had not sent his propositions, either to the prince or to
any of his courtiers. The chaplain seems to have expressed some
surprise at this, and Luther answers:&mdash;"I did not wish my theses
to reach our illustrious prince or any of his court, before those who
think themselves specially addressed had received them, lest
it should be thought that I had published them by order of the
prince or to gain his favour, or from opposition to the Bishop of
Mentz. I hear there are already several who dream such things.
But now I can swear in all safety that my theses were published
without the knowledge of Duke Frederick."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>If Spalatin solaced his friend, and supported him by his influence,
Luther on his part was desirous to meet the requests of
the modest chaplain. The latter, among other questions, asked
one which is frequently repeated in our day, "What is the best
method of studying the Holy Scriptures?"</p>

<p>"Till now, my dear Spalatin," replied Luther, "you have asked
questions which I could answer. But to direct you in the study
of the Scriptures is more than I am able to do. However, if you
would absolutely know my method, I will not hide it from you.</p>

<p>"It is most certain that we cannot succeed in comprehending
the Scripture either by study or mere intellect. Your first duty,
then, is to begin with prayer.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Entreat the Lord that he will in
his great mercy deign to grant you the true knowledge of his
Word. There is no other interpreter of the word of God than
the Author of that word according as it is said, 'They will all be
taught of God.' Hope nothing from your works, nothing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
your intellect. Trust only in God, and in the influence of his
Spirit. Believe one who is speaking from experience."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>We here see how Luther attained possession of the truth of
which he was a preacher. It was not, as some pretend, by confiding
in a presumptuous reason, nor, as others maintain, by abandoning
himself to hateful passions. The source from which he
drew it was the purest, holiest, and most sublime&mdash;God himself
consulted in humility, confidence, and prayer. Few in our day
imitate him, and hence few comprehend him. To a serious mind
these words of Luther are in themselves a justification of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Luther likewise found comfort in the friendship of respectable
laymen. Christopher Scheurl, the excellent secretary of the imperial
city of Nuremberg, gave him gratifying marks of his friendship.
We know how pleasant expressions of sympathy are to the
man who feels himself assailed from all quarters. The secretary
of Nuremberg did more; he tried to make friends to his friend.
He urged him to dedicate one of his works to a then celebrated
lawyer of Nuremberg, named Jerome Ebner:&mdash;"You have a high
idea of my studies," modestly replied Luther; "but I have the
poorest idea of them myself. Nevertheless, I was desirous to
meet your wishes. I have searched ... ; but in all my store,
which I never found so meagre, nothing presented itself which
seemed at all worthy of being dedicated to so great a man by so
little a man."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Striking humility! It is Luther who speaks thus,
and the person with whom he contrasts himself is Doctor Ebner,
who is altogether unknown to us. Posterity has not ratified
Luther's judgment.</p>

<p>Luther, who had done nothing to circulate his theses, had not
sent them to Scheurl any more than to the Elector and his courtiers.
The secretary of Nuremberg expressed his surprise. "I
had no intention," replies Luther, "to give my theses so much publicity.
I wished only to confer on their contents with some of
those who reside with us or near us;<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> intending, if they condemned,
to destroy, and if they approved, to publish them. But
now they are printed, reprinted, and spread far and wide, beyond
my expectation; so much so that I repent of their production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
Not that I have any fear of the truth being known by the people,
(for this was all I sought,) but this is not the way of instructing
them. There are questions in the theses as to which I have still
my doubts; and if I had thought that they were to produce
such a sensation, there are things which I would have omitted,
and others which I would have affirmed with greater confidence."
Luther afterwards thought differently. Far from fearing he had
said too much, he declared that he ought to have said still more.
But the apprehensions which Luther expresses to Scheurl do
honour to his sincerity. They show that he had nothing like a
premeditated plan, had no party spirit, no overweening conceit,
and sought nothing but the truth. When he had fully discovered
the truth, his language was different. "You will find in my first
writings," said he, many years after, "that I very humbly made
many concessions to the pope, and on points of great importance;
concessions which I now detest, and regard as abominable and
blasphemous."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Scheurl was not the only layman of importance who, at this
time, testified his friendship for Luther. The celebrated painter,
Albert Durer, sent him a present, (perhaps one of his pictures,)
and the doctor expressed his sense of the obligation in the warmest
terms.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Thus Luther had practical experience of the truth of that saying
of Divine wisdom:&mdash;"A friend loveth at all times; and a
brother is born for adversity." Those words he remembered for
the sake of others also, and accordingly pleaded the cause of the
whole population. The Elector had just levied a tax, and it was
confidently alleged that he was going to levy another, probably
on the advice of his counsellor Pfeffinger, against whom Luther
often throws out cutting sarcasms. The doctor boldly placed himself
in the breach. "Let not your Highness," said he, "despise
the prayer of a poor mendicant. In the name of God I entreat
you not to order a new tax. My heart is broken, as well as that
of several of your most devoted servants, at seeing how much the
last has injured your fair fame, and the popularity which your
Highness enjoyed. It is true that God has endowed you with
profound intellect, so that you see much farther into things than
I, or doubtless all your subjects, do. But, perhaps, it is the will
of God that a feeble intellect instruct a great one, in order that no
one may trust in himself, but only in the Lord our God. May he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
deign to keep your body in health for our good, and destine your
soul to life eternal. Amen." In this way it is that the gospel,
while it makes us honour kings, makes us also plead the cause of
the people. While it tells them of their duties, it, at the same
time, reminds the prince of their rights. The voice of a Christian
such as Luther, raised in the cabinet of a sovereign, might often
supply the place of a whole assembly of legislators.</p>

<p>In this letter, in which Luther addresses a harsh lesson to the
Elector, he fears not to present a request to him, or rather to remind
him of a promise, viz., to give him a new suit. This freedom
of Luther, at a moment when he might have feared he had
given offence to Frederick, is equally honourable to the prince and
to the Reformer. "But," adds he, "if it is Pfeffinger who has
the charge of it, let him give it in reality, and not in protestations
of friendship. He knows very well how to weave a web of good
words, but no good cloth ever comes out of it." Luther thought,
that, by the faithful counsel which he had given to his prince, he
had well deserved his court dress.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Be this as it may, two years
later he had not received it, and renewed his request.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> This seems
to indicate that Frederick was not so much under the influence of
Luther as has been said.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Disputation at Frankfort&mdash;Tezel's Theses&mdash;Menaces&mdash;Opposition of Knipstrow&mdash;Luther's
Theses Burnt&mdash;The Monks&mdash;Luther's Peace&mdash;Tezel's Theses Burnt&mdash;Luther's
Vexation.</p></blockquote>


<p>The minds of men had thus gradually recovered from their first
alarm. Luther himself was disposed to declare that his words
did not mean so much as had been imagined. New circumstances
might divert public attention, and the blow struck at Roman doctrine
might, as had been the case with so many others, spend itself
in the air. The partisans of Rome prevented this result. They
fanned the flame instead of smothering it.</p>

<p>Tezel and the Dominicans replied haughtily to the attack which
had been made upon them. Burning with eagerness to crush the
audacious monk who had disturbed their traffic, and to gain the
favour of the Roman pontiff, they uttered cries of rage. They
maintained that to attack the indulgence ordered by the pope was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to attack the pope himself, and they called in the aid of all the
monks and theologians of their school.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> In fact, Tezel felt that
an opponent like Luther was too much for him single-handed.
Quite disconcerted, but more especially enraged at the doctor's
attack, he quitted the environs of Wittemberg, and repaired to
Frankfort on the Oder, where he arrived as early as November,
1517. The university of that town, like that of Wittemberg, was
of recent date. One of the professors was Conrad Wimpina, a
man of much eloquence, an old rival of Pollich of Mellerstadt, and
one of the most distinguished theologians of the time. Wimpina's
envy was excited both by the doctor and by the university of Wittemberg;
for their reputation obscured his. Tezel applied to him
for a reply to Luther's theses, and Wimpina wrote two series of
antitheses, the former to defend the doctrine of indulgences, and
the latter to defend the authority of the pope.</p>

<p>This disputation, which had been long prepared and loudly advertised,
and of which Tezel entertained the highest hopes, took
place on the 20th January, 1518. Tezel having beaten up for recruits,
monks had been sent from all the neighbouring cloisters,
and assembled to the number of more than three hundred. Tezel
read his theses, one of which declared, "that whosoever says that
the soul does not fly away from purgatory as soon as the money
tinkles on the bottom of the strong box, is in error."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>But, above all, he maintained propositions, according to which,
the pope appeared to be truly, as the apostle expresses it, <i>seated as
God in the temple of God</i>. It was convenient for this shameless
merchant to take refuge under the pope's mantle, with all his disorders
and scandals.</p>

<p>In presence of the numerous assembly in which he stood, he declared
himself ready to maintain as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>3. "Christians must be taught that the pope, by the greatness
of his power, is above the whole universal Church and all councils.
His orders ought to be implicitly obeyed.</p>

<p>4. "Christians must be taught that the pope alone is entitled
to decide in matters of Christian faith; that he, and none but he,
has the power to explain the meaning of Scripture in his own
sense, and to approve or condemn all words or works of others.</p>

<p>5. "Christians must be taught that the judgment of the pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in things which concern Christian faith, and which are necessary
to the salvation of the human race, cannot possibly err.</p>

<p>6. "Christians must be taught that in matters of faith they
ought to lean and rest more upon the opinion of the pope, as manifested
by his decisions, than on the opinion of all wise men, as
drawn by them out of Scripture.</p>

<p>8. "Christians must be taught that those who attack the
honour and dignity of the pope are guilty of the crime of lese-majesty,
and deserve malediction.</p>

<p>17. "Christians must be taught that there are many things
which the Church regards as authentic articles of universal truth,
although they are not found either in the canon of Scripture or in
ancient doctors.</p>

<p>44. "Christians must be taught to regard those as obstinate
heretics, who, by their words, their actions, or their writings, declare
that they would not retract their heretical propositions were
excommunication after excommunication to rain or hail upon
them.</p>

<p>48. "Christians must be taught that those who protect heretics
in their error, and who, by their authority, prevent them from
being brought before the judge who is entitled to try them, are
excommunicated; that if, in the space of a year, they desist not
from doing so, they will be declared infamous, and severely punished
with various punishments, in terms of law, and to the terror
of all men.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>50. "Christians must be told that those who spoil so many
books and so much paper, and who preach or dispute publicly and
wickedly on the confession of the mouth, the satisfaction of works,
the rich and great indulgences of the Bishop of Rome, and on his
power; that those who ally themselves with those so preaching or
writing, who take pleasure in their writings, and circulate them
among the people and in the world; that those, in fine, who secretly
speak of those things in a contemptuous and irreverent
manner, may well tremble at incurring the pains which have just
been named, and of precipitating themselves and others with
them, at the last day, into eternal condemnation, and even here
below into great disgrace. For every beast that toucheth the
mountain shall be stoned."</p>

<p>We see that Luther was not the only person whom Tezel
attacked. In the forty-eighth thesis he had probably the Elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of Saxony in view. These propositions savour much of the Dominican.
To threaten every contradictor with severe punishment
was an inquisitor's argument, and scarcely admitted of a reply.
The three hundred monks whom Tezel had brought together gaped
and stared in admiration of his discourse. The theologians of the
university were too much afraid of being classed with the abettors
of heresy, or were too much attached to the principles of Wimpina,
candidly to adopt the extraordinary theses which had just been
read.</p>

<p>The whole affair, about which so much noise had been made,
seemed destined to be only a sham fight; but among the crowd
of students present at the disputation was a young man of about
twenty, named John Knipstrow. He had read the theses of
Luther, and found them conformable to the doctrines of Scripture.
Indignant at seeing the truth publicly trampled under foot, while
no one appeared to defend it, this young man rose up, to the great
astonishment of the whole assembly, and attacked the presumptuous
Tezel. The poor Dominican, who had not counted on such
opposition, was quite disconcerted. After some efforts, he quitted
the field of battle, and gave place to Wimpina, who made a more
vigorous resistance; but Knipstrow pressed him so closely, that,
to put an end to a contest, which in his eyes was so unbecoming,
Wimpina, who presided, declared the discussion closed, and proceeded
forthwith to confer the degree of doctor on Tezel, in recompence
of this glorious combat. Wimpina, to disencumber himself
of the young orator, caused him to be sent to the convent of
Pyritz in Pomerania, with orders that he should be strictly watched.
But this dawning light was only removed from the banks of
the Oder that it might afterwards shed a bright effulgence in Pomerania.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
When God sees it meet, he employs scholars to confound
teachers.</p>

<p>Tezel, wishing to repair the check which he had received, had
recourse to the <i>ultima ratio</i> of Rome and the inquisitors,&mdash;I mean
the faggot. On a public walk in one of the suburbs of Frankfort,
he caused a pulpit and a scaffold to be erected, and repaired thither
in solemn procession with his <i>insignia</i> of inquisitor. Mounting the
pulpit, he let loose all his fury. He darted his thunder, and with
his Stentorian voice exclaimed, that the heretic Luther ought to
be burned alive. Then placing the doctor's theses and sermon on
the scaffold, he burned them.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> He was better acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
this kind of work than with the defence of theses. Here he met
with no opponents, and his victory was complete. The impudent
Dominican returned in triumph to Frankfort. When parties in
power are vanquished, they have recourse to certain demonstrations
which must be conceded to them as a kind of consolation to
their disgrace.</p>

<p>The second theses of Tezel form an important epoch in the Reformation.
They changed the locality of the dispute, transporting
it from the indulgence market to the halls of the Vatican, and
diverting it from Tezel to the pope. Instead of the contemptible
creature whom Luther had taken in his fist, they substituted the
sacred person of the Head of the church. Luther was stunned at
this. It is probable that he would himself have taken the step at
a later period, but his enemies spared him the trouble. Thenceforward
the question related not merely to a disreputable traffic,
but to Rome; and the blow by which a bold hand had tried to
demolish the shop of Tezel, shook the very foundations of the pontifical
throne.</p>

<p>Tezel's theses were only a signal to the Roman troops. A
cry against Luther arose among the monks, who were infuriated
at the appearance of an adversary more formidable than
either Erasmus or Reuchlin had been. The name of Luther
resounded from the pulpits of the Dominicans, who addressed
themselves to the passions of the people, and inveighed against
the courageous doctor, as a madman, a deceiver, and a demoniac.
His doctrine was denounced as the most dreadful heresy. "Wait
only for a fortnight, or four weeks at farthest," said they, "and
this noted heretic will be burned." Had it depended only on
the Dominicans, the fate of the Saxon doctor had soon been that
of Huss and Jerome, but his life was destined to accomplish what
the ashes of Huss had begun. Each does the work of God, one by
his death, and another by his life. Several now began to cry
out that the whole university of Wittemberg was tainted with
heresy, and pronounced it infamous.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> "Let us pursue the villain,
and all his partisans," continued they. In several places these
exclamations had the effect of stirring up the passions of the
people. Those who shared the opinions of the Reformer had the
public attention directed towards them; and in every place where
the monks were strongest, the friends of the gospel felt the effects
of their hatred. Thus, in regard to the Reformation, the Saviour's
prediction began to be accomplished, "They will revile you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for
my sake." This is a recompence which the world at no time fails
to bestow on the decided friends of the gospel.</p>

<p>When Luther was made acquainted with Tezel's theses, and
with the general attack of which they were the signal, his courage
rose. He felt that it was necessary to withstand such adversaries
to the face; and his intrepid zeal had no difficulty in resolving so
to do. At the same time, their feebleness made him aware of his
own strength, and told him what he was.</p>

<p>He did not, however, allow himself to give way to those emotions
of pride which are so natural to the heart of man. "It gives
me more difficulty," he writes to Spalatin, "to refrain from despising
my adversaries, and so sinning against Jesus Christ, than it
would give me to vanquish them. They are so ignorant in things
human and divine, that one is ashamed at having to fight with
them; and yet it is their very ignorance which gives them their
inconceivable audacity and face of brass."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> But the most powerful
support to Luther's heart, in the midst of this universal opposition,
was the deep conviction that his cause was the cause of truth.
"Let it not surprise you," he writes to Spalatin, at the beginning
of the year 1518, "that I am so much insulted. I am delighted
with these insults. Did they not curse me, I could not believe so
firmly that the cause which I have undertaken is God's own cause.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
Christ has been set up for a sign to be spoken against. I know,"
added he, "that from the beginning of the world the nature of the
word of God has been such, that every one who has preached it
to the world, has been obliged, like the apostles, to leave all and
lay his account with death. Were it otherwise, it would not be
the word of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> This peace in the midst of agitation
is a thing unknown to the world's heroes. Men placed at the head
of a government, or of a political party, are seen to give way under
their labours and their vexations. The Christian in his struggles
usually acquires new strength, because he has access to a mysterious
source of repose and courage, unknown to those whose eyes
are closed to the gospel.</p>

<p>One thing, however, sometimes distressed Luther, viz., the
thought of the dissensions which his courageous opposition might
produce. He knew that a single word might be sufficient to set
the world in a flame; and when he foresaw prince against prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and perhaps nation against nation, his patriotic heart was saddened,
and his Christian charity alarmed. His wish was for peace;
but he behoved to speak out. So God required. "I tremble,"
said he, "I shudder at the thought of being the cause of discord
among such mighty princes."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>He still kept silence in regard to Tezel's propositions concerning
the pope. Had he been carried away by passion, he would
doubtless have made an impetuous assault on the extraordinary
doctrine under which his opponents sought to take shelter. He
did not do so; and there is in this delay, reserve, and silence,
something grave and solemn, which sufficiently explains the spirit
by which he was animated. He waited, but not through weakness;
for when he struck he gave a heavier blow.</p>

<p>Tezel, after his <i>auto da fe</i> at Frankfort on the Oder, had hastened
to send his theses into Saxony. There, thought he, they will serve
as an antidote to those of Luther. A man from Halle, employed
by the inquisitor to circulate his propositions, arrived at Wittemberg.
The students of the university, still indignant at Tezel for
having burned the theses of their master, no sooner heard of the
messenger's arrival, than they sought him out, and, gathering
round, jostled and frightened him. "How dare you bring such
things here?" demanded they. Some purchasing part of the copies
with which he was provided, and others seizing the rest, they got
possession of his whole stock, amounting to eight hundred copies.
Then, unknown to the Elector, the senate, the rector, Luther, and
all the other professors,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> they put up the following notice on the
boards of the university:&mdash;"Whosoever is desirous to be present
at the burning and funeral of Tezel's theses, let him repair at
two o'clock to the market-place."</p>

<p>Crowds assembled at the hour, and committed the propositions
of the Dominican to the flames, amid loud acclamations. One
copy which escaped, Luther afterwards sent to his friend, Lange
of Erfurt. These generous but imprudent youths followed the old
precept, "<i>Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth</i>" and not that of Jesus
Christ; but after the example which doctors and professors had
given at Frankfort, can we be astonished that young students
followed it at Wittemberg? The news of this academical execution
spread throughout Germany, and made a great noise.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Luther
was extremely vexed at it.</p>

<p>"I am astonished," he writes to his old master, Jodocus, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Erfurt, "how you could think it was I that burned Tezel's theses.
Do you think that I am so devoid of sense? But what can I do?
When I am the subject of remark, every thing seems to be believed.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
Can I tie up the tongues of the whole world? Very
well! Let them say, let them hear, let them see, let them pretend
whatever they please; I will act as long as the Lord gives me
strength, and with his help will fear nothing." "What will come
out of it," says he to Lange, "I know not, unless it be that my
danger is much increased."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The act of the students shows how
much their hearts already burned for the cause which Luther
defended. This was an important symptom; for a movement
among the young of necessity soon extends to the whole nation.</p>

<p>The theses of Tezel and Wimpina, though little esteemed, produced
a certain effect. They heightened the dispute, widened the
rent which had been made in the mantle of the Church, and
brought questions of the highest interest into the field. Accordingly,
the heads of the Church began to look more narrowly at the
matter, and to declare decidedly against the Reformer. "Verily, I
know not in whom Luther confides," said the Bishop of Brandenburg,
"when he dares thus attack the power of bishops." Perceiving
that this new circumstance called for new proceedings, the
bishop came in person to Wittemberg; but he found Luther animated
with the inward joy which a good conscience imparts, and
determined to give battle. The bishop felt that the Augustin monk
was obeying an authority superior to his, and returned to Brandenburg
in a rage. One day, in the winter of 1518, when sitting
at his fireside, he turned to those who were about him and said,
"I will not lay down my head in peace till I have thrown Martin
into the fire, as I do this brand," throwing one into the grate.
The revolution of the sixteenth century was not to be accomplished
by the heads of the Church any more than that of the first century
had been by the Sanhedrim and the synagogue. In the
sixteenth century, the heads of the Church were opposed to Luther,
the Reformation, and its ministers, in the same way as they were
opposed to Jesus Christ, the gospel, and his apostles, and as they
too often are at all times to the truth. "The bishops," says
Luther, in speaking of the visit which the Bishop of Brandenburg
had paid him, "begin to perceive that they ought to have done
what I am doing, and they are consequently ashamed. They call
me proud and audacious, and I deny not that I am so. But they
are not the people to know either what God is, or what we are."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>A more serious resistance than that of Tezel was already opposed
to Luther. Rome had answered. A reply had issued from
the walls of the sacred palace. It was not Leo X who had taken
it into his head to speak theology. "A quarrel of monks," he had
one day said. "The best thing is not to meddle with it." And on
another occasion, "It is a drunken German who has written these
theses; when he recovers from his wine he will speak differently."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
A Dominican of Rome, Sylvester Mazolini de Prierio or Prierias,
master of the sacred palace, exercised the functions of censor, and
in this character was the first man in Italy who knew of the Saxon
monk's theses.</p>

<p>A Roman censor and the theses of Luther! What a rencounter!
Liberty of speech, liberty of investigation, liberty of faith, come
into collision in Rome, with that power which pretends to have in
its hands a monopoly of intelligence, and to open and shut the
mouth of Christendom at its pleasure. The struggle between
Christian liberty, which begets children of God, and pontifical
despotism, which begets slaves of Rome, is, as it were, personified
during the first days of the Reformation, in the encounter between
Luther and Prierio.</p>

<p>The Roman censor, prior-general of the Dominicans, employed
to determine what Christendom must say, or not say, and know
or not know, hastened to reply, and published a tract, which he
dedicated to Leo X. He spoke contemptuously of the German
monk, and declared, with a self-sufficiency altogether Roman,
"that he was anxious to know whether this Martin had a nose of
iron, or a head of brass, which could not be broken."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Then, in
the form of a dialogue, he attacked the theses of Luther, employing
alternately, ridicule, insult, and threatening.</p>

<p>The combat between the Augustin of Wittemberg and the Dominican
of Rome took place on the very question which lies at the
foundation of the Reformation; viz., "What is the sole infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
authority to Christians?" The following is the system of the
Church, as expounded by its most independent organs.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>The letter of the written Word is dead without the spirit of interpretation,
which alone unfolds its hidden meaning. Now this
spirit is not granted to every Christian, but to the Church; in
other words, to the priests. It is great presumption to maintain,
that he who promised to be with his Church always to the end of
the world, could abandon it to the power of error. It will be said,
perhaps, that the doctrine and constitution of the Church are not
the same as we find them in the sacred oracles. This is true; but
the change is only apparent, relating to the form, and not to the
substance. Moreover, the change is an advance. The living power
of the Spirit has given reality to what exists in Scripture only in
idea; it has embodied the sketches of the Word, put a finishing
hand to these sketches, and completed the work of which the Bible
had furnished only the first outlines. Scripture ought, therefore,
to be understood in the sense determined by the Church, under
the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Here the Catholic doctors are
divided. General councils, say some, and Gerson among the
number, are the representatives of the Church. The pope, says
others, is the depositary of the Spirit of interpretation; and no
man is entitled to understand Scripture in a sense differing from
that of the Roman pontiff. This was the opinion of Prierio.</p>

<p>Such was the doctrine which the master of the sacred palace
opposed to the rising Reformation. On the power of the pope and
the Church he advanced propositions at which the most shameless
flatterers of the court of Rome would have blushed. The following
is one of the points which he maintains at the commencement
of his tract:&mdash;"Whoever rests not in the doctrine of the Roman
Church, and the Roman pontiff, as the infallible rule of faith, from
which the Holy Scripture itself derives its force and authority, is
a heretic."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Then in a dialogue, in which Luther and Sylvester are the
speakers, the latter tries to refute the doctor's propositions. The
sentiments of the Saxon monk were quite new to a Roman censor.
Accordingly, Prierio shows that he understood neither the emotions
of his heart, nor the motives of his conduct. To the teacher of
truth he applied the little standards of the valets of Rome. "Dear
Luther!" says he, "were you to receive a bishopric and a plenary
indulgence for the repair of your Church from our lord the pope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
you would proceed more gently, and would even prose in favour
of the indulgence which you are now pleased to blacken!" The
Italian, so proud of the elegance of his manners, sometimes assumes
the most scurrilous tone. "If the property of dogs is to bite,"
says he to Luther, "I fear your father must have been a dog."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
The Dominican begins at last to be almost astonished at his own
condescension in speaking to a rebellious monk; and concludes
with showing his opponent the cruel teeth of an inquisitor. "The
Roman Church," says he, "having in the pope the summit of
spiritual and temporal power, may, by the secular arm, constrain
those who after receiving the faith, stray from it. She is not
bound to employ arguments for the purpose of combating and subduing
the rebellious."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>These words traced by the pen of one of the dignitaries of the
Roman court had a very significant meaning. They failed, however,
to terrify Luther. He believed, or feigned to believe, that
this dialogue was not by Prierio, but by Ulrich von Hütten, or by
some other of the authors of "The Letters of some Obscure
Men," who (said he in his sarcastic strain) had, in order to stir
up Luther against Prierio, compiled this mass of absurdity.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> He
had no desire to see the court of Rome in arms against him.
However, after remaining for some time silent, his doubts, if he
had any, having been dispelled, he set to work, and in two days
after was prepared with his reply.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The Bible had produced the Reformer and begun the Reformation.
Luther, in believing, had no need of the testimony of the
Church. His faith was derived from the Bible itself; from within,
and not from without. His thorough conviction that the evangelical
doctrine was immovably founded on the word of God made him
regard all external authority as useless. Luther's experience, in
this respect, opened a new prospect to the Church. The living
spring which had burst forth before the monk of Wittemberg, was
destined to become a stream at which nations would quench their
thirst.</p>

<p>The Church had said that, in order to understand the Word, the
Spirit of God must interpret it, and so far the Church was right.
But her error consisted in regarding the Holy Spirit as a monopoly
conferred on a certain caste, and in thinking that it could be appropriated
exclusively to certain assemblies and colleges, to a city or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a conclave. "The wind bloweth where it listeth," were the words
of the Son of God, when speaking of the Spirit of God; and, on
another occasion, "They will ALL be taught of God." The corruption
of the Church, the ambition of pontiffs, the animosities
of councils, the squabbles of the clergy, and the pomp of prelates,
had made this Holy Spirit, this breath of humility and peace, eschew
the dwelling of the priesthood. He had deserted the assemblies of
the proud, and the palaces of the princes of the Church, and gone
to live in retirement among simple Christians and modest priests.
He had shunned a domineering hierarchy, which often forced
blood from the poor, whom it trampled under foot; he had
shunned a proud and ignorant clergy, whose chiefs were skilled,
not in the Bible, but in the sword; and he was found sometimes
among despised sects, and sometimes among men of talents and
learning. The holy cloud, withdrawing from proud basilisks and
gorgeous cathedrals, had descended on the obscure dwellings of
the humble, or on chambers where studious men calmly pursued
their conscientious labours. The Church, degraded by her love of
power and riches, dishonoured in the eyes of the people by the
venal use which she made of the doctrine of life; the Church which
sold salvation in order to fill a treasury, for luxury and debauchery
to empty, had lost all respect. Men of sense no longer set any
value on her testimony, but, despising an authority so degraded,
turned with joy, towards the Divine word, and its infallible authority,
as toward the only refuge which remained to them in the
general confusion.</p>

<p>The age, therefore, was prepared. The bold movement by which
Luther changed the point on which the human heart rested its
highest hopes, and with a mighty hand transferred those hopes from
the walls of the Vatican to the rock of the word of God, was hailed
with enthusiasm. This was the work which the Reformer had in
view in his reply to Prierio.</p>

<p>Putting aside the axioms which the Dominican had placed at the
head of his work, he says, "After your example, I, too, am going
to lay down some axioms."</p>

<p>"The first is the saying of St. Paul, 'Should we, or an angel from
heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have
preached unto you, let him be accursed.'"</p>

<p>The second is the following passage of St. Augustine, addressed
to St. Jerome:&mdash;"I have learned to pay to the canonical books
alone the honour of believing very firmly that none of them has
erred; as to others, I believe not what they say, for the simple
reason, that it is they who say it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>Luther then vigorously proceeds to lay down the fundamental
principles of the Reformation,&mdash;<i>the word of God, the whole word
of God, and nothing but the word of God</i>. "If you understand
these principles," continues he, "you will also understand that your
whole dialogue is completely overturned; for you have done nothing
else than adduce the words and opinions of St. Thomas." Next,
attacking the axioms of his opponent, he frankly declares his opinion
that popes and councils may err. He complains of the flattery of
the Roman courtiers in attributing to the pope the alleged infallibility
of both popes and councils, and declares that the Church
exists virtually only in Christ, and representatively only in Councils.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Coming afterwards to the supposition which Prierio had made, he
says, "No doubt you judge me by yourself, but if I aspired to a
bishopric, assuredly I would not use language which sounds so
hateful in your ears. Do you imagine I am ignorant how bishoprics
and the popedom are procured at Rome? Do not the very children
in the streets sing the well known words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Rome now-a-days is more unclean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ought that in the world is seen?'"<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was among the stanzas current in Rome before the election
of one of the last popes. Nevertheless, Luther speaks of Leo with
respect. "I know," says he, "that in him we have, as it were, a
Daniel in Babylon; his integrity has repeatedly endangered his
life." He concludes with a few words in reply to the menaces of
Prierio: "In fine, you say that the pope is at once pontiff and
emperor, and that he has power to constrain by the secular arm.
Are you thirsting for murder? Take my word for it, your rhodomontades
and your loud-sounding threats cannot terrify me. Though
I be killed, Christ lives, Christ my Lord, and the Lord of all, blessed
for ever and ever. Amen."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Thus Luther with a strong arm assails the infidel altar of the
papacy, opposing to it the altar of the word of God, alone holy,
alone infallible, before which he would have every knee to bow, and
on which he declares himself ready to sacrifice his life.</p>

<p>Prierio published a reply, and after it a third treatise on "the
Irrefragable Truth of the Church and of the Roman Pontiff," in
which, founding on ecclesiastical law, he says, that though the pope
were to send the people and himself to the devil <i>en masse</i>, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
not for so doing be either judged or deposed.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The pope was at
length obliged to impose silence on Prierio.</p>

<p>A new opponent soon entered the list. He too was a Dominican.
James Hochstraten, inquisitor at Cologne, whom we have already
seen assailing Reuchlin and the friends of letters, was furious when
he saw Luther's boldness. It was indeed necessary that darkness
and monkish fanaticism should engage in close fight with him who
was to give them their death-blow. Monkism was formed after
primitive truth had begun to decay, and from that period downward,
errors and monks had gone hand in hand. The man who
was to hasten their ruin had appeared; but these sturdy champions
would not quit the field without a fierce combat. This combat
they continued to wage with him throughout his whole life,
though the proper personification of it is in Hochstraten; Hochstraten
and Luther&mdash;the one, the free and intrepid Christian, and
the other, the blustering slave of monkish superstition. Hochstraten
unchains his rage, and, with loud cries, demands the death
of the heretic.... His wish is to secure the triumph of Rome
by means of the flames. "It is high treason against the Church,"
exclaims he, "to let so execrable a heretic live another single
hour. Let a scaffold be instantly erected for him!" This sanguinary
counsel was, alas! but too well followed in many countries;
the voice of numerous martyrs, as in the first days of the
Church, bore testimony to the truth in the midst of the flames.
But in vain were fire and sword invoked against Luther. The
angel of Jehovah constantly encamped around him and shielded
him.</p>

<p>Luther replied to Hochstraten briefly, but very energetically.
"Go," says he to him, when concluding; "go, delirious murderer,
whose thirst can only be quenched by the blood of the brethren.
My sincere desire is, that you guard against calling me a Christian
and a believer, and that, on the contrary, you never cease to denounce
me as a heretic. Understand these things well, you bloody
man, you enemy of the truth; and if your furious rage impel you
to devise mischief against me, do it with circumspection, and time
your measures well. God knows what I purpose if he grants me
life. My hope and expectation (God willing) will not deceive
me."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Hochstraten was silent.</p>

<p>A more painful attack awaited the Reformer. Dr. Eck, the
celebrated professor of Ingolstadt, who procured the liberty of
Urban Regius, Luther's friend, had received the famous theses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Eck was not the man to defend the abuses of indulgences, but he
was a doctor of the school, and not of the Bible, being well versant
in scholastics, but not in the word of God. If Prierio had represented
Rome, and Hochstraten had represented the monks, Eck
represented the School. The School which, for about five centuries,
had ruled Christendom, far from yielding to the first blows of the
Reformer, proudly rose up to crush the man who dared to assail it
with floods of contempt. Eck and Luther, the School and the Word,
came to blows on more than one occasion; but the present was the
occasion on which the combat commenced.</p>

<p>Eck must have regarded several of Luther's assertions as erroneous;
for nothing obliges us to question the sincerity of his convictions.
He defended the scholastic opinions with enthusiasm, just as
Luther defended the declarations of the word of God. We may
even suppose that he was somewhat pained at seeing himself
obliged to oppose his old friend, and yet it would seem, from the
mode of attack, that passion and jealousy had some share in his
determination.</p>

<p>He gave the name of <i>Obelisks</i> to his remarks on the theses of
Luther. Wishing at first to save appearances, he did not publish
his work, but contented himself with communicating it confidentially
to his ordinary, the Bishop of Eichstädt. Soon, however, whether
through the indiscretion of the bishop, or of Eck himself, the
<i>Obelisks</i> were circulated in all quarters. A copy having fallen into
the hands of a friend of Luther, Link, preacher at Nuremberg,
he lost no time in sending it to the Reformer. Eck was a much
more formidable opponent than Tezel, Prierio, and Hochstraten;
his work was the more dangerous the more it surpassed theirs in
knowledge and subtlety. He affected pity for his "feeble opponent,"
(knowing well that pity injures more effectually than
anger,) and insinuated that the propositions of Luther contained
Bohemian poison, and savoured of Bohemia. By these malicious
insinuations he threw upon Luther the obloquy and hatred which
in Germany attached to the name of Huss and the schismatics of
his country.</p>

<p>The malice which shone through this treatise roused Luther's
indignation, while the thought that the blow was given by an old
friend, was still more distressing. However, he must sacrifice his
affections in defending the truth. Luther unbosomed his heart and
its sadness, in a letter to Egranus, pastor at Zwickau&mdash;"I am called
in the <i>Obelisks</i> a venomous man, a Bohemian, a heretic, seditious,
insolent, and presumptuous.... I say nothing of milder
epithets, such as sleepy, imbecile, ignorant, contemner of the sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
pontiff, etc. This book is full of the grossest insults, and
yet the author is a distinguished man, alike remarkable for learning
and talent; and (it is this that grieves me most) a man with
whom I had recently contracted a close friendship,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> viz., John
Eck, doctor in theology, and chancellor of Ingolstadt, a celebrated
and illustrious author. Did I not know the thoughts of Satan, I
would be astonished at the furious manner in which this man has
broken off a friendship at once so pleasant and so recent;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and this
without giving me any warning&mdash;without writing or saying a single
word."</p>

<p>But if Luther's heart be wounded, his courage is not destroyed.
On the contrary, he girds himself for the combat. "Rejoice, my
brother," says he to Egranus, whom a violent enemy had also
attacked; "rejoice, and be not alarmed at all these flying leaves.
The more furious my adversaries become, the more I advance. I
leave the things which are behind, that they may bark after them,
and follow those which are before, that they may in like manner
bark after them in their turn."</p>

<p>Eck felt how shameful his conduct had been, and endeavoured
to justify it in a letter to Carlstadt, in which he calls Luther "their
common friend;" and throws all the blame on the Bishop of Eichstadt,
at whose instigation he pretended that he had written the
work. His intention, he said, was not to publish the <i>Obelisks</i>; but
for this he would have had more regard for the friendship subsisting
between him and Luther; and he requested that Luther, instead
of coming to open rupture with him, would turn his arms against
the theologians of Frankfort. The professor of Ingolstadt, who had
not feared to strike the first blow, began to be alarmed at the power
of the opponent whom he had imprudently attacked, and would
willingly have evaded the contest. It was too late.</p>

<p>All these fine words did not persuade Luther, who was, however,
disposed to be silent, and said, "I will patiently swallow this morsel,
though fit for Cerberus."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> But his friends were of a different
opinion, and urged, or rather constrained him to answer. He,
accordingly, replied to the <i>Obelisks</i> by his <i>Asterisks</i>, opposing (as he
says, playing upon the word) to the rust and lividity of Obelisks
the light and dazzling brightness of the stars of heaven. In this
work he treats his new opponent less harshly than those whom he
had previously combated; but his indignation is seen peeping through
his words.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
He showed that in the chaos of the <i>Obelisks</i> there was nothing
from the holy Scriptures, nothing from the Fathers of the Church,
and nothing from the ecclesiastical canons; that they contained only
scholastic glosses, and opinion after opinion, many of them mere
dreams;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> in a word, contained the very things which Luther had
attacked. The Asterisks are full of spirit and life. The author's
indignation rises at the errors of his friend's book, but he shows
pity to the man.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> He reiterates the fundamental principle which
he had laid down in his reply to Prierio:&mdash;"The sovereign pontiff
is a man, and may be led into error; but God is truth, and cannot
be deceived."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Then employing the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>
against the scholastic doctor, he says to him, "It is certainly impudent
in any one to teach, as the philosophy of Aristotle, any
dogma which cannot be proved by his authority. You grant this.
Well, then, it is <i>a fortiori</i>, the most impudent of all things to
affirm in the Church and among Christians anything that Jesus
Christ himself has not taught.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Now in what part of the Bible is
it said that the treasure of Christ's merits is in the hands of the
pope?"</p>

<p>He adds, "As to the malicious charge of Bohemian heresy, I
patiently bear the reproach for the love of Jesus Christ. I live in
a celebrated university, a distinguished town, an important bishopric,
and a powerful duchy, where all are orthodox, and where, doubtless,
no toleration would be given to so wicked a heretic."</p>

<p>Luther did not publish <i>The Asterisks</i>; he only communicated
them to his friends. It was not till a later period that they were
given to the public.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>This rupture between the doctor of Ingolstadt and the doctor of
Wittemberg made a sensation in Germany. They had common
friends. Scheurl, in particular, by whose instrumentality their
friendship appears to have been originally formed, was exceedingly
annoyed. He was one of those who longed to see a reform throughout
the whole Germanic church, produced through the medium
of its most distinguished organs. But if in matters of principle
the most eminent theologians of the period came to open rupture,
and while Luther advanced in a new path, Eck put himself at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
head of those who kept to the old path, what disruption must
inevitably ensue? Would not numerous adherents gather around
each of the two chiefs, and form two hostile camps in the heart of
the empire?</p>

<p>Scheurl exerted himself to reconcile Eck and Luther. The latter
declared that he was willing to forget every thing; that he loved
the genius, and admired the erudition of Dr. Eck,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and that the
proceedings of his old friend had caused him more grief than anger.
"I am ready," says he, "either for peace or war; but I prefer
peace. Do you then set about it. Grieve with us, that the devil
has thrown among us this beginning of strife, and then rejoice that
Christ in his mercy hath removed it."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> About the same time, he
addressed a most friendly letter to Eck, who, however, not only did
not answer it, but did not even send him a verbal message."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> It
was too late for reconciliation; and the breach became wider and
wider. The pride of Eck, and his unforgiving temper, soon completely
broke any remaining ties of friendship.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Popular Writings&mdash;Our Father&mdash;Thy Kingdom Come&mdash;Thy Will be Done&mdash;Our
Daily Bread&mdash;Sermon on Repentance&mdash;Forgiveness through Christ.</p></blockquote>


<p>Such were the struggles which the champion of the word of God
had to maintain at the outset of his career. But these combats
with the leaders of society, these academical disputes, are of small
account with the Christian. Human doctors imagine they have
gained the noblest of triumphs if they succeed in filling some newspapers
and some saloons with the noise of their systems. As it is
with them more an affair of self-love, or party spirit, than of good
to humanity, this worldly success satisfies them. Accordingly,
their labours are only a smoke, which, after blinding us, passes off
and leaves no trace behind. Neglecting to introduce their fire
among the masses of the population, they do nothing more than
make it skim along the surface of society.</p>

<p>It is not so with the Christian. His object is not success in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
coterie, or an academy, but the salvation of souls. He therefore
willingly avoids the brilliant skirmishing, which he might carry on
at his ease with the champions of the world, and prefers the obscure
labours which carry life and light into rural cottages, and
the lanes of cities. Thus did Luther, or rather according to the
precept of his Master, <i>he did the one, without leaving the other
undone</i>. While combating inquisitors, university chancellors,
and masters of the sacred palace, he strove to diffuse sound
religious knowledge among the multitude. With that view, he
at this time published different popular writings, such as his
<i>Discourses on the Ten Commandments</i>, delivered two years before
in the church of Wittemberg, and which we have already noticed;
and his <i>Exposition of the Lord's Prayer, for simple and ignorant
laymen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Who would not like to know how the Reformer then
addressed the people?</p>

<p>We will quote some of the words which he sent, as he says,
in the preface to the second of these works, "to course the
country."</p>

<p>Prayer, that inward act of the heart, will doubtless ever be one
of the points with which a reformation in heart and life must
commence, and, accordingly, it early engaged the attention of
Luther. It is impossible, in a translation, to keep up his energetic
style, and the vigour of a language which was formed so to speak,
as it fell from his pen; however, we will try.</p>

<p>"When you pray," says he, "have few words, but many
thoughts and affections, and, above all, let these be profound. The
less you speak, the better you pray. Few words and many
thoughts make the Christian, many words and few thoughts, the
pagan.</p>

<p>"Seeming and bodily prayer is that muttering of the lips, that
external babble, which comes forth without attention, striking the
eyes and ears of men; but prayer in spirit and in truth is the
inward desire, the emotions, and sighs which proceed from the
depths of the heart. The former is the prayer of hypocrites, and
of all who trust in themselves. The latter is the prayer of the
children of God, who walk in his fear."</p>

<p>Then coming to the first words of our Lord's Prayer, "Our
Father," he thus expresses himself:&mdash;"Among all the names of
God, there is none which inclines more toward him than the
name of Father. We should not have so much happiness and consolation
in calling him Lord, or God, or Judge.... By this name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of father his bowels of compassion are moved; for there is no
voice more lovely or touching than that of a child to its father.</p>

<p>"<i>Who art in heaven.</i> He who confesses that he has a Father
in heaven owns himself to be, as it were, an orphan on the earth.
Hence his heart feels an ardent desire like that of a child living
out of its father's country, among strangers, in wretchedness and
sorrow. It is as if he said, 'Alas! my father! thou art in heaven,
and I, thy miserable child, am on the earth, far from thee, in all
sorts of dangers, necessities, and sorrows.'</p>

<p>"<i>Hallowed be thy name!</i> He who is passionate and envious,
who curses or slanders, dishonours God, in whose name he was
baptized. Applying the vessel which God has consecrated to
profane uses, he resembles a priest who should use the holy cup to
give drink to a sow, or to gather manure.</p>

<p>"<i>Thy kingdom come.</i> Those who amass wealth, who erect
magnificent buildings, who seek after all that the world can give,
and with the lips repeat this prayer, are like the large pipes of a
church organ, which sounds and cries at full pitch, and without
ceasing, but has neither words, nor sense, nor reason."...</p>

<p>Farther on, Luther attacks the error of pilgrimages, which was
then so general. "One goes to Rome, another to St. James; one
builds a chapel, another founds an endowment, in order to reach
the kingdom of God; but all neglect the essential point, which is
to become themselves his kingdom. Why do you go beyond seas
in quest of the kingdom of God?... Your heart is the place in
which it ought to rise.</p>

<p>"It is a dreadful thing," continues he, "to hear us utter this
prayer, '<i>Thy will be done</i>.' Where in the Church do we see this
will done?... Bishop rises against bishop, and church against
church. Priests, monks, and nuns, quarrel and fight; throughout
there is nothing but discord. And yet all parties exclaim that
they have a good will and an upright intention; and so to the
honour and glory of God they altogether do the work of the
devil....</p>

<p>"Why do we say <i>our bread</i>?" continues he, "explaining these
words, "<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>." "Because we pray,
not for the ordinary bread which pagans eat, and which God
gives to all men, but for <i>our</i> bread&mdash;bread to us, children of the
heavenly Father.</p>

<p>"And what, then, is this bread of God? It is Jesus Christ our
Lord; '<i>I am the living bread which came down from heaven, and
give life to the world</i>.' Wherefore let us not deceive ourselves.
Sermons and instructions which do not represent to us, or give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
us the knowledge of Jesus Christ, cannot be the daily bread and
food of our souls....</p>

<p>"What avails it that such a bread is prepared for us, if it is
not served out to us, and we cannot taste it?... It is as if a
magnificent feast were prepared, and there were nobody to hand
the bread, bring the dishes, and pour out the liquor; so that the
guests would be left to feed by the eye and the smell.... This
is the reason why it is necessary to preach Christ, and Christ alone.</p>

<p>"But what, then, you ask, is it to know Jesus Christ, and
what profit is gained by it? Answer:&mdash;To learn to know Jesus
Christ is to comprehend what the Apostle says&mdash;<i>Christ has of
God been made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,
and redemption</i>. Now, you comprehend this when you perceive
that your wisdom is culpable folly, your righteousness damnable
iniquity, your holiness damnable pollution, your redemption
miserable condemnation&mdash;when you feel that, before God and
all the creatures, you are truly a fool, a sinner, an impure and
condemned man&mdash;and when you show, not only by your words,
but from the bottom of your heart, and by your works, that
there remains to you no comfort and no salvation, save Jesus
Christ. To believe is nothing else than to eat this bread of
heaven."</p>

<p>Thus Luther faithfully fulfilled his resolution to open the eyes
of a people whom priests had blindfolded, and were leading at
their pleasure. His writings, which in a short time spread over
all Germany, caused new light to arise, and shed the seeds of
truth in abundance on a soil well prepared to receive it. But
while thinking of those at a distance, he did not forget those who
were near.</p>

<p>The dominicans from their pulpits denounced him as an infamous
heretic. Luther, the man of the people, and who, had he
been so disposed, could with a few sentences have set them in
commotion, always disdained such triumphs, and made it his sole
aim to instruct his hearers.</p>

<p>His reputation, which was continually extending, and the courage
with which he raised the banner of Christ in the midst of an
enslaved Church, made his sermons be followed with increasing
interest. Never had the confluence been so great. Luther went
straight to the point. One day, having mounted the pulpit of
Wittemberg, he undertook to establish the doctrine of repentance.
The discourse pronounced on this occasion afterwards became
very celebrated, and contains several of the fundamental principles
of evangelical doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>At first he contrasts the pardon of men with the pardon of
heaven. "There are," says he, "two remissions&mdash;the remission
of the penalty, and the remission of the fault. The former
reconciles man externally with the Church; the latter, which is
the heavenly indulgence, reconciles man with God. If a man has
not within himself that tranquil conscience, that cheerful heart
which God's remission gives, no indulgence can aid him were he
to buy all that ever have been on the earth."</p>

<p>He afterwards continues thus: "They wish to do good works
before their sins are pardoned, whereas sins must be pardoned before
good works can be done. Works do not banish sin; but
banish sin, and you will have works.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Good works should be
done with a cheerful heart and a good conscience toward God; in
other words, with the forgiveness of sins."</p>

<p>He then comes to the principal object of his sermon, an object
which was identified with that of the whole Reformation. The
Church had put herself in the place of God and his word; he objects
to this, and makes every thing depend on faith in the word.</p>

<p>"The remission of the fault," says he, "is not in the power of the
pope, or the bishop, or the priest, or any man whatever, but rests
solely on the word of Christ, and your own faith. For Christ did
not choose to build our comfort or our salvation on a word or
work of man, but only on himself, on his own work and word.
Your repentance and your works may deceive you, but Christ
your God will never deceive, will never waver; and the devil
cannot overthrow his words."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>"A pope or a bishop has no more power than the humblest priest
where the remission of the fault is in question. And even where
there is no priest, each Christian, were it a woman or a child,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
can do the same thing. For if a simple Christian says to you,
'God pardons sin in the name of Jesus Christ,' and you receive
the saying with firm faith, as if God himself had spoken, you are
acquitted.</p>

<p>"If you believe not that your sins are pardoned, you make your
God a liar, and declare that you put greater confidence in your
vain thoughts than in God and his word.</p>

<p>"Under the Old Testament neither priest, nor king, nor prophet,
had power to proclaim the forgiveness of sins; but under the New
Testament every believer has this power. The Church is quite
replete with the remission of sins.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> If a pious Christian comforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
your conscience by the word of the cross, be it man or woman,
young or old, receive the comfort with a faith so firm, that
you would sooner submit to many deaths than doubt that it is
ratified in the presence of God.... Repent, and do all the
works that you can do; but let the faith which you have in the
pardon of Jesus Christ stand in the front rank, and have sole command
on the field of battle."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Thus spoke Luther to his astonished and enraptured hearers.
All the scaffoldings which impudent priests had, for their own profit,
reared between God and the soul of man, were thrown down,
and man brought face to face with his Maker. The word of pardon
came down pure from on high, without passing through a
thousand corrupting channels. It was no longer necessary that
the testimony of God, in order to be available, should previously
be stamped by men with their false seal. The monopoly of the
sacerdotal caste was abolished, and the Church emancipated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fire which had been kindled at Wittemberg
behoved to be kindled elsewhere. Luther, not contented with
announcing the truth in the place of his residence, whether to the
academic youth or to the people, was desirous to shed the seeds
of sound doctrine in other places. The Augustin order were to
hold their general chapter at Heidelberg, in the spring of 1518.
Luther, as one of the most distinguished men of the order, was invited
to attend; but his friends did all they could to dissuade him
from undertaking the journey. In fact, the monks had laboured
to render the name of Luther odious in all the places through
which he had to pass. To insult they had added threatening; and
a small matter might have sufficed to excite a popular tumult of
which he might have been made the victim. "Or even," said
his friends, "what they may not dare to do by violence, they will
accomplish by fraud and stratagem."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> But in the discharge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
duty, Luther did not allow himself to be arrested by the fear of
any danger, however imminent. He therefore turned a deaf ear
to the timid suggestions of his friends, and directed them to Him
in whom his confidence was placed, and under whose protection
he desired to undertake the perilous journey. After the feast of
Easter he quietly set out on foot,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> on the 13th April 1518.</p>

<p>He had with him a guide named Urban, who carried his small
bundle, and was to accompany him as far as Wurzburg. How
many thoughts must have occupied the heart of the servant of the
Lord during this journey! At Weissenfels, the pastor, though not
of his acquaintance, instantly recognised him as the doctor of
Wittemberg, and gave him a hearty reception.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> At Erfurt, he was
joined by two other Augustin friars. At Judenbach, the three fell
in with Degenard Pfeffinger, the Elector's confidential councillor,
who entertained them at the inn. "I have had the pleasure," wrote
Luther to Spalatin, "of making this rich lord some shillings
poorer. You know how I like to take every occasion of making
a hole in the purses of the rich for the benefit of the poor, especially
if the rich are my friends."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> He arrived at Coburg, worn
out with fatigue. "All goes well by the grace of God," wrote he;
"only, I confess I have sinned in undertaking the journey on
foot. But for this sin I presume I will have no need of the remission
of indulgences, for my contrition is perfect, and my satisfaction
complete. I am knocked up with fatigue, and all the
conveyances are full. Is not this enough, or rather more than
enough of penitence, contrition, and satisfaction?"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The Reformer of Germany, not finding a place in the public
conveyances, nor any one who was willing to yield him his place,
was obliged next morning, notwithstanding of his fatigue, humbly
to resume his journey on foot. He arrived at Wurzburg on the
evening of the second Sabbath after Easter, and sent back his
guide.</p>

<p>Bishop Bibra, who had received the theses with so much delight,
lived in this town, and Luther had a letter for him from the
Elector of Saxony. The bishop, overjoyed at the opportunity of
becoming personally acquainted with this bold champion of the
truth, hastened to invite him to the episcopal palace. He went out
to receive him, spoke to him in the kindest terms, and offered to
furnish him with a guide as far as Heidleberg. But at Wurzburg,
Luther had fallen in with his two friends, the vicar-general
Staupitz, and Lange, the prior of Erfurt, who offered him a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in their carriage. He therefore thanked Bibra for his offer, and
next day the three friends set out from Wurzburg. They travelled
thus for three days, conversing together, and on the 21st
April arrived at Heidelberg. Luther went to lodge at the Augustin
convent.</p>

<p>The Elector of Saxony had given him a letter to Count Palatine
Wolfgang, Duke of Bavaria. Luther repaired to his magnificent
castle, the site of which is still the admiration of strangers. The
monk of the plains of Saxony had a heart to admire the position
of Heidelberg, where the two lovely valleys of the Rhine and the
Necker unite. He delivered his letter to James Simler, steward
of the court. Simler having read it, said, "Truly you have here a
valuable letter of credit." The Count Palatine received him with
much kindness, and often invited him, as well as Lange and Staupitz,
to his table. This friendly reception added greatly to Luther's
comfort. "We relax and amuse ourselves with an agreeable and
pleasant chit-chat," says he, "eating and drinking, and surveying
all the magnificence of the Palatine palace, admiring its ornaments,
its armoury, and cuirasses; in short, every thing remarkable in this
distinguished and truly royal castle."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>However, Luther had other work to do. He behoved to work
while it was day. Transported to an university which exercised
great influence on the west and south of Germany, he was there to
strike a blow which should shake the churches of those countries.
He, accordingly, began to write theses which he proposed to maintain
in a public discussion. Such discussions were of ordinary occurrence;
but Luther felt, that in order to make his useful, it was
necessary to give it a peculiar interest. His disposition, moreover,
inclined him to present the truth under a paradoxical form. The
professors of the university would not allow the discussion to take
place in their public hall, and it became necessary to hold it in a
hall of the Augustin convent. The 26th of April was the day on
which it was to take place.</p>

<p>Heidelberg, at a later period, received the gospel, and even at
this discussion in the convent, an observer might have augured
that good would result from it.</p>

<p>The reputation of Luther attracted a large concourse of hearers;
professors, courtiers, citizens, and students, crowded to it. The
doctor gave the name of Paradoxes to his theses, and it is, perhaps,
the name which might still be applied to them in the present day.
It would be easy, however, to translate them into evident propositions.
The following are some of the Paradoxes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>1. "The law of God is a salutary rule of life. Nevertheless, it
cannot aid man in his search after righteousness; on the contrary,
it impedes him.</p>

<p>3. "Works of man, how fair and good soever they may be, are,
to all appearance, only mortal sins.</p>

<p>4. "Works of God, how deformed and bad soever they may appear,
have always an immortal merit.</p>

<p>7. "The works of the just themselves would be mortal sins, did
they not, through holy reverence for the Lord, fear that their works
would in fact be mortal sins.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>9. "To maintain that works done without Christ are dead, but
not mortal, is dangerous forgetfulness of the fear of God.</p>

<p>13. "Since the fall of man, free will exists only in name, and
when man does all that is possible for him to do, he sins mortally.</p>

<p>16. "A man who expects to attain to grace by doing all that it
is possible for him to do, adds sin to sin, and doubles his guilt.</p>

<p>28. "The love of God finds nothing in man, but creates in him

<p>Five doctors of theology attacked these theses. They had read
them with the astonishment which novelty excites. The theology
seemed to them very strange. Yet according to Luther's own
testimony, they discussed them with a courtesy which he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
not but esteem; and, at the same time, with force and discernment.</p>

<p>Luther, on his part, displayed an admirable mildness in his replies,
incomparable patience in listening to the objections of his
opponents, and all the liveliness of St. Paul in solving the difficulties
which were started. His answers, which were short, but replete
with the word of God, filled all the hearers with admiration.
"He very much resembles Erasmus," said several; "but in one
thing he surpasses him,&mdash;he professes openly what Erasmus is contented
only to insinuate."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>The discussion was drawing to a close. Luther's opponents had
retired with honour from the field of battle, the youngest of them,
Doctor George Niger, alone continuing the struggle with the mighty
combatant. Amazed at the bold propositions of the Augustin
monk, and feeling utterly at a loss for arguments to refute them,
he exclaimed, in an agitated tone,&mdash;"Were our peasants to hear
such things, they would stone you to death."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> At these words
there was a general laugh throughout the audience.</p>

<p>Never had hearers listened more attentively to a theological disputation.
The first words of the Reformer had awakened men's
minds, and questions which shortly before had met with indifference,
were now full of interest. Several countenances gave visible expression
to the new ideas which the bold assertions of the Saxon
doctor had suggested to their minds.</p>

<p>Three youths in particular were strongly moved. One of them,
named Martin Bucer, was a Dominican, of about twenty-seven
years of age, who, notwithstanding of the prejudices of his order,
seemed unwilling to lose a single word which fell from the doctor.
Born in a little town of Alsace, he had entered a convent at sixteen,
and soon displayed such talents that the monks entertained
the highest hopes of him.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> "He will one day be an ornament to
our order," said they. His superiors had sent him to Heidelberg
that he might devote himself to the study of philosophy, theology,
Greek, and Hebrew. At this period Erasmus having published
several of his works, Bucer read them with avidity.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the first works of Luther appeared, and the Alsatian
student hastened to compare the Reformer's doctrine with the
holy Scriptures. Some doubt as to the truth of the popish religion
arose in his mind.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> This was the way in which light was diffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in those days. The Elector Palatine took notice of the young man.
His strong and sonorous voice, his pleasing address, his eloquence,
and the freedom with which he attacked prevailing vices, made
him a distinguished preacher. He was appointed chaplain to the
court, and was acting in this capacity when Luther's journey to
Heidelberg was announced. Bucer was greatly delighted; nobody
repaired with greater eagerness to the hall of the Augustin convent.
He had provided himself with paper, pens, and ink, wishing to
write down whatever the doctor should say. But while his hand
was rapidly tracing the words of Luther, the hand of God was
writing the great truths which he heard in more ineffaceable characters
on his heart. The rays of the doctrine of grace beamed upon
his soul on this memorable occasion.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The Dominican was gained
over to Christ.</p>

<p>Not far from Bucer sat John Brentz or Brentius, then about
nineteen years of age. Brentz, who was the son of a magistrate
of a town in Swabia, had, at thirteen, been enrolled among the
students of Heidelberg. None of them showed such application.
As soon as the hour of midnight struck, Brentz rose and commenced
his labours. This practice became so habitual to him, that, during
the rest of his life, he could never sleep beyond that hour. At a
later period he devoted these still moments to meditation on the
Scriptures. Brentz was one of the first to perceive the new light
which then rose on Germany, and he received it into his soul in
the full love of it.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> He read the writings of Luther with avidity,
and must have been overjoyed at the prospect of hearing him personally
at Heidelberg. Young Brentz was particularly struck with
one of the doctor's propositions, viz., "Not he who does many
works is justified before God, but he who, without works, believes
much in Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>A pious woman of Heilbronn, on the Necker, wife of a councillor
of that town, named Snepf, had, after the example of Hannah,
dedicated her first born to the Lord, earnestly desiring to see him
devote himself to theology. The young man, who was born in
1495, made rapid progress in literature, but whether from taste
or ambition, or compliance with his father's wishes, he devoted
himself to the study of law. The pious mother was grieved when
she saw her son Ehrhard following another course than that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
which she had dedicated him; she warned and urged him, and
always concluded by reminding him of the vow which she had
made at his birth.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> At length, overcome by his mother's perseverance,
Ehrhard Snepf yielded, and soon felt such delight in his
new studies, that nothing in the world could have diverted him
from them.</p>

<p>He was in terms of intimacy with Bucer and Brentz, and they remained
friends all their lives; "for," says one of their biographers,
"friendships founded on the love of literature and virtue are never
extinguished." He was present with his two friends at the Heidelberg
discussion. The Paradoxes and the bold struggle of the Wittemberg
doctor gave Snepf a new impulse. Rejecting the vain dogma
of human merit, he embraced the doctrine of free justification.</p>

<p>The next day Bucer paid a visit to Luther. "I conversed with
him," says he, "and without witnesses; and had a most exquisite
repast, not from the viands, but from the truths which were set before
me. Whatever objections I stated, were readily answered by
the doctor, who explained every thing with the utmost clearness.
O! that I had time to write you more about it."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Luther himself
was touched with the sentiments of Bucer. "He is the only
friar of his order," wrote he to Spalatin, "who is in good faith.
He is a young man of great promise; he received me with simplicity,
and conversed with me with earnestness; he is deserving
of our confidence and our love."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Brentz, Snepf, and others also, urged by the new truths which
began to dawn upon their minds, in like manner visited Luther,
speaking and conferring with him, and asking explanations of any
thing which they might not have comprehended. The Reformer,
in his answers, founded upon the Bible. At every word that fell
from him fresh light arose, and his visitors saw a new world opening
before them.</p>

<p>After Luther's departure these noble-minded men began to
teach at Heidelberg. It was necessary to follow out what the man
of God had begun, and not allow the torch which he had kindled
to be extinguished. The scholars will speak should the masters be
silent. Brentz, although he was still so youthful, explained St.
Matthew, at first in his own room, and afterwards, when it could
not contain his hearers, in the hall of philosophy. The theologians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
filled with envy at seeing the great concourse which he drew together,
were much offended.</p>

<p>Brentz next took orders, and transferred his lectures to the college
of the Canons of the Holy Spirit. In this way the fire which
had already been kindled in Saxony was kindled also in Heidelberg.
The light radiated from numerous <i>foci</i>. This period has
been designated the seed-time of the Palatinate.</p>

<p>But the fruits of the Heidelberg discussion were not confined to the
Palatinate. These bold friends of the truth soon became luminaries
in the Church. They all occupied eminent stations, and took
part in the numerous discussions, to which the Reformation gave
rise. Strasburg, and at a later period England, were indebted to
the labours of Bucer, for a purer knowledge of the truth. Snepf
taught first at Marburg, then at Stutgard, Tubingen, and Jena.
Brentz, after teaching at Heidelberg, long continued to labour at
Halle, in Swabia, and at Tubingen. These three individuals will
again come before us.</p>

<p>This discussion caused Luther himself to advance. He grew
daily in the knowledge of the truth. "I am one of those," said
he, "who have made progress by writing and by instructing
others; and not one of those, who, from nothing, become all at
once great and learned doctors."</p>

<p>He was delighted at seeing the avidity with which youth in
schools received the growing truth; and this consoled him when
he saw how deeply the old doctors were rooted in their opinions.
"I have the glorious hope," said he, "that, in like manner as
Christ, when rejected by the Jews, went to the Gentiles, we
will now see true theology, though rejected by these old men of
vain and fantastical opinions, welcomed by the rising generation."<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>The Chapter being closed, Luther thought of returning to Wittemberg.
The Count Palatine gave him a letter to the Elector, in
which he said that "Luther had displayed so much ability in the
discussion as to reflect great glory on the university of Wittemberg."
He was not permitted to return on foot.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The Augustins
of Nuremberg conducted him as far as Wurzburg, and from
thence he proceeded to Erfurt with the friars belonging to it. As
soon as he arrived he called on his old master Jodocus. The venerable
professor, who had been much concerned and shocked
at the career which his pupil had followed, was accustomed to
put a theta (&#952;) before all Luther's sentences,&mdash;that being the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which the Greeks used to express condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> He had written
to the young doctor, censuring his conduct, and he was anxious
to answer by word of mouth. Not having been received, he wrote
Jodocus:&mdash;"The whole university, with the exception of a single
licentiate, thinks as I do. Nay, more; the prince, the bishop,
several other prelates, and all our enlightened citizens, declare,
with one voice, that hitherto they have neither known nor understood
Jesus Christ and his gospel. I am ready to receive your
correction, and though it should be harsh I will think it pleasant.
Unbosom your heart then without fear, disburden yourself of
your anger. I have no wish, I am not able to be angry with you.
God and my conscience bear witness."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The aged doctor was touched by the sentiments of his old pupil,
and wished to see if there was no means of removing the condemnatory
theta. They had an explanation; but nothing resulted
from it. "I have at least," said Luther, "made him understand,
that all their sentences are like the beast which is said to eat itself.
But it is vain to speak to the deaf. The doctors cling obstinately
to their petty distinctions, although they confess that they have
nothing to support them but what they term the light of natural
reason&mdash;a dark chaos to us who proclaim no other light than
Jesus Christ, the only true light."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Luther quitted Erfurt in the carriage of the convent. He was
thus brought to Eisleben, and from thence the Augustins of the
place, proud of a doctor who threw so much lustre on their order
and on their town which had given him birth, caused him to be
conveyed to Wittemberg with their own horses, and at their own
expence. All were desirous to testify affection and esteem for the
extraordinary man who was rising at every step.</p>

<p>He arrived on Saturday after the Ascension. The journey had
done him good. His friends found him stronger and healthier
looking than before his departure,<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> and were delighted with all he
told them. Luther reposed for some time from the fatigues of his
campaign and the discussion at Heidelberg, but this repose was only
a preparation for more severe exertions.</p>

<h3>LUTHER BEFORE THE LEGATE.</h3>

<p class="center">MAY-DECEMBER, 1518.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Repentance&mdash;The Pope&mdash;Leo X&mdash;Luther to his Bishop&mdash;Luther to the Pope&mdash;Luther
to the Vicar-General&mdash;Rovere to the Elector&mdash;Discourse on Excommunication&mdash;Influence
and Power of Luther.</p></blockquote>


<p>Truth had at length raised her head in the bosom of Christendom.
Victorious over the inferior organs of the papacy, she behoved to
have a struggle with its chief. We are going to see Luther at
close quarters with Rome.</p>

<p>This step was taken on his return from Heidelberg. His first
theses on indulgences had been misunderstood, and he determined
to explain their meaning with greater clearness. The outcry raised
by the blind hatred of his enemies had convinced him how important
it was to gain the most enlightened part of the nation in
favour of truth, and he resolved to appeal to its judgment by calling
attention to the foundation on which his convictions rested. It was,
indeed, necessary for once to appeal to the decision of Rome; and
he hesitates not to send all his explanations. Presenting them
with one hand to the enlightened and impartial among his countrymen,
he with the other lays them before the throne of the sovereign
pontiff.</p>

<p>These explanations of his theses, which he denominated <i>Solutions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
were written with great moderation. Luther tried to soften
the passages which had caused most irritation, and gave proof of
genuine modesty. At the same time, he showed that his convictions
were immovable; and he courageously defended all the propositions
which truth obliged him to maintain. He again repeated,
that every Christian who truly repents possesses the remission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
sins without indulgence; that the pope, like the humblest of priests,
can only declare simply what God has already pardoned; that the
treasure of the merits of the saints administered by the pope was a
chimera, and that Holy Scripture was the only rule of faith. Let
us hear himself on some of these points.</p>

<p>He begins with establishing the nature of true penitence, and
contrasts the divine act, which renews man, with the mummery of
the Romish Church. "The Greek word &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#949;," says he, "signifies&mdash;be
clothed with a new spirit and new feelings; have a new
nature; so that, ceasing to be earthly, you may become heavenly....
Christ is a teacher of the spirit and not of the letter, and his
words are spirit and life."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> He, therefore, inculcates, not those
external penances which the proudest sinners can perform without
being humbled, but a repentance according to spirit and truth&mdash;a
repentance which may be fulfilled in all the situations of life, under the
purple of kings, the cassock of priests, and the coronet of princes,
amid the magnificence of Babylon, where a Daniel lived, as well as
under a monk's frock and a beggar's tatters.</p>

<p>Farther on we meet with these bold words, "I give myself no
trouble as to what pleases or displeases the pope. He is a man like
other men. There have been several popes who loved not only
errors and vices, but even things still more extraordinary. I listen
to the pope as pope, that is when he speaks in the canons, according
to the canons, or when he decides some article with a council, but
not when he speaks out of his own head. If I did otherwise, would
I not be bound to say with those who know not Jesus Christ, that
the horrible massacres of Christians of which Julius II was guilty,
were the kind acts of an affectionate shepherd towards the Lord's
sheep?"<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>"I cannot but be astonished," continues he, "at the simplicity of
those who have said that the two swords of the gospel represent,
the one the spiritual power, and the other the temporal. Yes, the
pope holds a sword of steel, and so exhibits himself to Christendom,
not as a tender father, but as a formidable tyrant. Ah! God in
his anger has given us the sword we wished, and withdrawn that
which we despised. In no quarter of the world have there been
more dreadful wars than among Christians.... Why did the
ingenious intellect which discovered this fine commentary, not with
equal subtlety interpret the history of the two keys committed to St.
Peter, and in that way make it an established dogma of the Church,
that the one serves to open the treasures of heaven, and the other
the treasures of the world."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
"It is impossible," he again says, "that a man can be a Christian
without having Christ; and if he has Christ, he at the same
time has all that belongs to Christ. The thing which gives peace
to our conscience is, that by faith our sins are no longer ours, but
Christ's, on whom God has laid them; and that, on the other hand,
all the righteousness of Christ is ours, to whom God has given it.
Christ puts his hand upon us, and we are cured. He throws his
mantle over us and we are covered; for he is the glorious Saviour,
blessed for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>With such views of the riches of salvation by Jesus Christ, there
was no need of indulgences.</p>

<p>Luther, while attacking the papacy, speaks honourably of Leo
X. "The times in which we live are so bad," says he, "that even
the greatest personages cannot come to the help of the Church. We
have now a very good pope in Leo X. His sincerity and knowledge
fill us with joy. But what can one man, though amiable and
agreeable, do by himself alone? He certainly deserved to be pope
in better times. We, in our day, deserve only such popes as Julius
II, and Alexander VI."</p>

<p>He afterwards comes to the crowning point. "I wish to say
the thing in a few words and boldly. The Church stands in need
of a reformation; and this cannot be the work either of a single
man, like the pope, or of many men, like the cardinals, and fathers
of councils; but it must be that of the whole world, or, rather, it is
a work which belongs to God only. As to the time in which such
a reformation ought to begin, He alone who created time can tell....
The embankment is broken down, and it is no longer in
our power to arrest the torrents which are rushing impetuously
along."</p>

<p>Such are some of the thoughts and declarations which Luther
addressed to the enlightened among his countrymen. The Feast
of Pentecost was at hand; and, at this period, when the apostles
rendered the first testimony of their faith to the risen Saviour,
Luther, a new apostle, published this enlivening book in which he
expressed his earnest longings for a resurrection of the Church.
Saturday, 22nd May, 1518, being Pentecost eve, he sent his work
to his ordinary, the Bishop of Brandenburg, with the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Most worthy Father in God</span>,&mdash;Some time ago, when a
novel and unheard-of doctrine, touching the apostolic indulgences,
began to make a noise in these countries, both learned and ignorant
felt concerned; and many persons, some of them known to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and others whom I did not even know by face, urged me to publish,
by word of mouth, or by writing, what I thought of the novelty, I
am unwilling to say, the impudence of this doctrine. At first I was
silent, and kept back. But at length matters came to such a point,
that the holiness of the pope was compromised.</p>

<p>"What was I to do? I thought it best neither to approve nor
to condemn these doctrines; but to establish a discussion on this
important point, until the Holy Church should decide.</p>

<p>"Nobody having come forward to this combat, to which I had
invited all the world, and my theses having been considered not as
materials for discussion, but positive assertions,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> I feel myself obliged
to publish an explanation of them. Deign, then, most gracious
Bishop, to receive these trifles<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> at my hand. And that all the world
may see I am not acting presumptuously, I supplicate your reverence
to take pen and ink, and blot out, or even throw into the fire and
burn, whatever in them displeases you. I know that Jesus Christ
has no need of my labours and my services, and that he can very
well, without me, publish good tidings to his Church. Not that the
bulls and menaces of my enemies deter me; very much the contrary.
If they were not so impudent and so shameless, nobody
would hear a word from me; I would shut myself up in a corner,
and there study by myself for myself. If this affair is not of God,
it certainly cannot be my affair, nor that of any man, but a thing
of nought. Let the glory and honour be ascribed to Him to whom
alone they belong."</p>

<p>Luther had still the greatest respect for the head of the Church.
He supposed that there was justice in Leo X, and a sincere love of
truth. He resolved, therefore, to apply to him also; and eight
days after, on Trinity Sunday, 30th May, 1518, addressed him in a
letter, of which we give the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To the Most Blessed Father, <span class="smcap">Leo X</span>, Sovereign Bishop,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Friar Martin Luther, Augustin, wishes eternal salvation!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I learn, most Holy Father, that evil reports are current with
regard to me, and that my name is brought into bad odour with
your Holiness. I am called heretic, apostate, traitor, and a thousand
other opprobrious epithets; what I see astonishes, what I hear
amazes me. But the only foundation of my tranquillity remains,
and that is a pure and peaceful conscience. Be pleased to listen
to me, most Holy Father, to me, who am only an ignorant child."</p>

<p>Luther relates the origin of the whole affair, and continues
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In all taverns, nothing was heard but complaints of the avarice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of priests, and attacks on the power of the keys and the
sovereign pontiff. This all Germany can testify. On hearing these
things, my zeal for the glory of Christ was moved, (so I thought,)
or if they will explain it otherwise, my young and boiling blood
was inflamed.</p>

<p>"I warned several of the princes of the Church, but some mocked
me, and others turned a deaf ear. All seemed paralysed by the
terror of your name. Then I published the discussion,</p>

<p>"And this, most Holy Father! this is the fire which is said to
have set the whole world in flames!</p>

<p>"Now, what must I do? I cannot retract, and I see that this
publication is subjecting me to inconceivable hatred in all quarters.
I love not to stand forth in the midst of the world; for I am without
knowledge, without talent, and far too feeble for such great
things, especially in this illustrious age, in which Cicero himself,
were he alive, would be obliged to hide in some obscure corner.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>"But in order to appease my adversaries, and respond to numerous
solicitations, I here publish my thoughts. I publish them,
Holy Father, that I may place myself in safety under the shadow
of your wings. All who are willing will thus be able to understand
with what simplicity of heart I have asked the ecclesiastical
authority to instruct me, and what respect I have shown for the
power of the keys.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> If I had not managed the affair in a becoming
manner, it is impossible that the most serene lord Frederick,
Duke and Elector of Saxony, who shines among the friends of
apostolical and Christian truth, would ever have tolerated in his
university of Wittemberg a man so dangerous as I am represented
to be.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, most Holy Father, I throw myself at the feet of
your Holiness, and submit to you with all I have, and all I am.
Destroy my cause, or embrace it; decide for me, or decide against
me; take my life, or restore it to me, just as you please. I will
recognise your voice as the voice of Jesus Christ, who presides
and speaks by you. If I have deserved death I refuse not to die.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
The earth belongs unto the Lord, and all that it contains. Let
him be praised to all eternity. Amen. May he sustain you for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>What humility and truth in this fear, or rather in this confession
of Luther, that his young and boiling blood had perhaps been
too quickly inflamed! We here recognise the man of sincerity,
who, not presuming on himself, fears the influence of passion
even in those of his actions which are most conformable to the
word of God. There is a wide difference between this language
and that of a proud fanatic. We see in Luther an earnest desire
to gain over Leo to the cause of truth, to prevent all disruption,
and make this reformation, the necessity of which he proclaims,
come from the very pinnacle of the Church. Assuredly, he is not
the person who ought to be charged with destroying in the West
that unity, the loss of which was afterwards so much regretted.
He sacrificed every thing in order to maintain it; every thing but
truth. It was not he, but his adversaries, who, by refusing to acknowledge
the fulness and sufficiency of the salvation wrought out
by Jesus Christ, are chargeable with having rent the Saviour's
robe at the foot of the cross.</p>

<p>After writing this letter, Luther, the very same day, addressed
his friend Staupitz, vicar-general of his order. It was through
him he wished his "Solutions" and his epistle to reach Leo.</p>

<p>"I pray you," says he to him, "kindly to accept the miserable
things<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> which I send you, and transmit them to the excellent
pope, Leo X. Not that I would thereby drag you into the perils
to which I am exposed. I wish to take all the danger to myself.
Jesus Christ will see whether what I have said comes from him or
comes from me&mdash;Jesus Christ, without whose will neither the tongue
of the pope can move, nor the hearts of kings resolve.</p>

<p>"To those who threaten me I have no answer to give, unless it
be the remark of Reuchlin, 'The poor man has nothing to fear, for
he has nothing to lose.'<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> I have neither money nor goods, and I
ask none. If I once possessed some honour and some reputation,
let him that has begun to strip me of them finish his work. I have
nothing left but this miserable body, enfeebled by so many trials;
let them kill it by force or fraud, to the glory of God. In this way
they will, perhaps, shorten my life an hour or two. Enough for
me to have a precious Redeemer, a powerful Priest, Jesus Christ
the Lord! I will praise him while I have a breath of life; and if
none will praise him with me, how can I help it?"</p>

<p>These words enable us to read Luther's heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>While he was thus looking with confidence towards Rome, Rome
had thoughts of vengeance towards him. On the 3rd of April,
Cardinal Raphael De Rovere had written to the Elector Frederick
in the pope's name, stating that suspicions were entertained of his
faith, and that he ought to beware of protecting Luther.</p>

<p>"Cardinal Raphael," says Luther, "would have had great
pleasure in seeing me burned by Duke Frederick."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Thus Rome
began to whet her arms against Luther, and the first blow which
she aimed at him was through the mind of his protector. If she
succeeded in destroying the shelter under which the monk of Wittemberg
was reposing, he would become an easy prey.</p>

<p>The German princes attached much importance to their reputation
as Christian princes. The slightest suspicion of heresy filled
them with alarm, and the court of Rome had shrewdly availed itself
of this feeling. Frederick, moreover, had always been attached
to the religion of his fathers, and Raphael's letter made a very
strong impression on his mind. But it was a principle with the
Elector not to act hastily in any thing. He knew that truth was
not always on the side of the strongest. The transactions of the
empire with Rome had taught him to distrust the selfish views of
that court; and he was aware that in order to be a Christian
prince, it was not necessary to be the pope's slave.</p>

<p>"He was not," says Melancthon, "one of those profane spirits
who wish to stifle all changes in their first beginnings.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Frederick
resigned himself to God. He carefully read the writings
which were published, and what he judged true he allowed no one
to destroy."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> He had power to do so. Supreme in his own
States, he was respected in the empire at least as highly as the
emperor himself.</p>

<p>It is probable that Luther learned something of this letter of
Cardinal Raphael, which was sent to the Elector on the 7th of
July. Perhaps it was the prospect of excommunication which this
Roman missive seemed to presage, that led him to mount the
pulpit of Wittemberg on the 15th of the same month, and on this
subject deliver a discourse which made a profound impression. He
distinguished between internal and external excommunication; the
former excluding from communion with God, and the latter excluding
only from the ceremonies of the Church. "Nobody,"
says he, "can reconcile a lapsed soul with God save God himself.
Nobody can separate man from communion with God unless it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
man himself by his own sins! Happy he who dies unjustly excommunicated!
While for righteousness' sake he endures a heavy
infliction on the part of man, he receives the crown of eternal
felicity from the hand of God."</p>

<p>Some highly applauded this bold language, while others were
more irritated by it. But Luther was no longer alone; and although
his faith needed no other support than that of God, a phalanx
of defence against his enemies was formed around him. The
Germans had heard the voice of the Reformer. His discourses
and his writings sent forth flashes which awoke and illumined his
contemporaries. The energy of his faith fell in torrents of fire on
slumbering hearts. The life which God had infused into this extraordinary
soul was imparted to the dead body of the Church;
and Christendom, which had for so many ages been motionless,
was animated with a religious enthusiasm. The devotedness of
the people to the superstitions of Rome diminished every day, and
the number of hands which offered money for the purchase of pardon
became fewer and fewer,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> while at the same time Luther's
fame continued to increase. People turned towards him, and
hailed him with love and respect as the intrepid defender of truth
and liberty.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> No doubt the full depth of the doctrines which he
announced was not perceived. It was enough for the greater
number to know that the new doctor withstood the pope, and that
the empire of priests and monks was shaken by his powerful word.
To them the attack of Luther was like one of those fires which
are kindled on mountain tops, as the signal for a whole nation to
rise and burst its chains. Before the Reformer suspected what
he had done, all the generous hearted among his countrymen had
already acknowledged him for their leader. To many, however,
the appearance of Luther was something more. The word of God,
which he wielded with so much power, pierced their minds like a
sharp two-edged sword; and their hearts were inflamed with an
ardent desire to obtain the assurance of pardon and eternal life.
Since primitive times the Church had not known such hungering
and thirsting after righteousness. If the preaching of Peter the
Hermit and Bernard so aroused the population of the middle ages
as to make them take up a perishable cross, the preaching of
Luther disposed those of his time to embrace the true cross, the
truth which saves. The framework which then lay with all its weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
on the Church had smothered everything; the form had destroyed
the life. But the powerful word given to Luther caused a quickening
breath to circulate over the soil of Christendom. At the
first glance the writings of Luther were equally captivating to believers
and unbelievers,&mdash;to unbelievers, because the positive doctrines
afterwards to be established were not yet fully developed in
them; and to believers, because they contained the germ of that
living faith which they so powerfully express. Hence the influence
of these writings was immense; they spread almost instantaneously
over Germany and the world. The prevailing impression of men
every where was, that they were assisting, not at the establishment
of a sect, but at a new birth of the Church and of society.
Those who were born of the Spirit of God ranged themselves
around him who was its organ. Christendom was divided into
two camps,&mdash;the one leagued with the spirit against the form, and
the other with the form against the spirit. It is true that on the
side of the form were all the appearances of strength and grandeur,
and on the side of the spirit those of feebleness and insignificance.
But the form, devoid of the spirit, is a lifeless body, which the first
breath may upset. Its appearance of power only provokes hostility
and accelerates its downfall. In this way the simple truth had
placed Luther at the head of a mighty army.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Diet at Augsburg&mdash;The Emperor to the Pope&mdash;The Elector to Rovere&mdash;Luther cited
to Rome&mdash;Luther's Peace&mdash;Intercession of the University&mdash;Papal Brief&mdash;Luther's
Indignation&mdash;The Pope to the Elector.</p></blockquote>


<p>This army was needed; for the great began to move. Both
the empire and the Church were uniting their efforts to rid themselves
of this troublesome monk. Had the imperial throne been
occupied by a brave and energetic prince, he might have profited
by these religious agitations, and, throwing himself on God and
the nation, given new force to the former opposition to the papacy.
But Maximilian was too old, and was determined, moreover, to
sacrifice every thing to what he regarded as the end of his existence,&mdash;the
aggrandisement of his house, and through it the exaltation
of his grandson.</p>

<p>The Emperor Maximilian at this time held a diet at Augsburg,
Six Electors attended in person, and all the Germanic States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
were represented at it, while the kings of France, Hungary, and
Poland, sent their ambassadors. All these princes and envoys
appeared in great splendour. The war against the Turks was one
of the subjects for which the diet had assembled. The legate
of Leo X strongly urged the prosecution of it; but the States,
instructed by the bad use which had formerly been made of their
contributions, and sagely counselled by the Elector Frederick, contented
themselves with declaring that they would take the matter
into consideration, and at the same time, produced new grievances
against Rome. A Latin discourse, published during the
Diet, boldly called the attention of the German princes to the true
danger. "You wish," said the author, "to put the Turk to flight.
This is well; but I am much afraid that you are mistaken as to
his person. It is not in Asia, but in Italy, that you ought to seek
him."<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Another affair of no less importance was to occupy the Diet.
Maximilian was desirous that his grandson Charles, already
king of Spain and Naples, should be proclaimed king of the
Romans, and his successors in the imperial dignity. The pope
knew his interest too well to wish the imperial throne to be occupied
by a prince whose power in Italy might prove formidable
to him. The Emperor thought he had already gained the greater
part of the electors and states, but he found a strenuous opponent
in Frederick. In vain did he solicit him, and in vain did the
ministers and best friends of the Elector join their entreaties to
those of the Emperor. Frederick was immovable, and proved
the truth of what has been said of him, that when once satisfied of
the justice of a resolution, he had firmness of soul never to abandon
it. The Emperor's design failed.</p>

<p>From this time the Emperor sought to gain the good will of the
pope, in order to render him favourable to his plans; and as a
special proof of his devotedness, on the 5th August, wrote him the
following letter:&mdash;"Most Holy Father, we learned some days ago
that a friar of the Augustin order, named Martin Luther, has
begun to maintain divers propositions as to the commerce in
indulgences. Our displeasure is the greater because the said friar
finds many protectors, among whom are powerful personages.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
If your Holiness and the very reverend fathers of the Church,
(the Cardinals,) do not forthwith employ their authority to put
an end to these scandals, not only will these pernicious doctors
seduce the simple, but they will involve great princes in their ruin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
We will take care that whatever your Holiness may decide on this
matter, for the glory of Almighty God, shall be observed by all in
our empire."</p>

<p>This letter must have been written after some rather keen discussion
between Maximilian and Frederick. The same day, the
Elector wrote to Raphael de Rovere. He had doubtless learned
that the Emperer was addressing the Roman pontiff, and to parry
the blow he put himself in communication with Rome.</p>

<p>"I can have no other wish," said he, "than to show myself submissive
to the universal Church. Accordingly, I have never defended
the writings and sermons of Doctor Martin Luther. I understand,
moreover, that he has always offered to appear with a safe-conduct
before impartial, learned, and Christian judges, in order to defend
his doctrine, and submit, in the event of being convinced by Scripture
itself."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>Leo X, who had hitherto allowed the affair to take its course,
aroused by the cries of theologians and monks, instituted an ecclesiastical
court, which was to try Luther at Rome, and in which
Sylvester Prierio, the great enemy of the Reformer, was at once
accuser and judge. The charge was soon drawn up, and Luther
was summoned by the court to appear personally in sixty days.</p>

<p>Luther was at Wittemberg, calmly awaiting the good effect which
his humble letter to the pope was, as he imagined, to produce, when,
on the 7th of August, only two days after the despatch of the letters
of Maximilian and Frederick, he received the citation from the
Roman tribunal. "At the moment," says he, "when I was expecting
the benediction, I saw the thunder burst upon me. I was
the lamb troubling the water to the wolf. Tezel escapes, and I must
allow myself to be eaten."</p>

<p>This citation threw Wittemberg into consternation; for whatever
course Luther might adopt, he could not avert the danger. If he
repaired to Rome he must there become the victim of his enemies.
If he refused to go, he would, as a matter of course, be condemned
for contumacy, without being able to escape; for it was known
that the legate had received orders from the pope to do everything
he could do to irritate the Emperor and the German princes against
him. His friends were in dismay. Must the teacher of truth go
with his life in his hand to that great city, <i>drunk with the blood of
the saints and martyrs of Jesus</i>? Is it sufficient to ensure any
man's destruction that he has raised his head from the bosom of
enslaved Christendom? Must this man, whom God appears to
have formed for resisting a power which hitherto nothing has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
able to resist, be also overthrown? Luther, himself, saw no one
who could save him unless it were the Elector, but he would rather
die than endanger his prince. His friends at last fell on an expedient
which would not compromise Frederick. Let him refuse a
safe-conduct, and Luther will have a legitimate cause for refusing
to appear at Rome.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August Luther wrote to Spalatin, praying that the
Elector would employ his influence to have him cited in Germany.
He also wrote to Staupitz, "See what ambuscades they use to ensnare
me, and how I am surrounded with thorns. But Christ lives
and reigns, to-day, yesterday, and for ever. My conscience assures
me that what I have taught is the truth, though it becomes still
more odious when I teach it. The Church is like the womb of
Rebecca. The children must struggle together so as even to endanger
the life of the mother.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> As to what remains, entreat the
Lord that I may not have too much joy in this trial. May God
not lay the sin to their charge."</p>

<p>The friends of Luther did not confine themselves to consultation
and complaint. Spalatin, on the part of the Elector, wrote to Renner,
the Emperor's secretary, "Dr. Martin is very willing that his
judges shall be all the universities of Germany, with the exception
of those of Erfurt, Leipsic, and Frankfort on the Oder, which he
has ground to suspect. It is impossible for him to appear personally
at Rome."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>The university of Wittemberg wrote a letter of intercession to
the pope himself, and thus spoke of Luther,&mdash;"The feebleness of
his body, and the dangers of the journey, make it difficult and
even impossible for him to obey the order of your Holiness. His
distress and his prayers dispose us to have compassion on him. We,
then, as obedient sons, entreat you, most Holy Father, to be
pleased to regard him as a man who has never taught doctrines in
opposition to the sentiments of the Roman Church." On the same
day the university, in its anxiety, addressed Charles de Miltitz, a
Saxon gentleman, the chamberlain, and a great favourite of the
pope, and bore testimony to Luther in terms still stronger than
those which it had ventured to insert in the former letter. "The
worthy father, Martin Luther, Augustin, is the noblest and most
honourable man of our university. For several years we have seen
and known his ability, his knowledge, his high attainments in arts
and literature, his irreproachable manners, and his altogether
Christian conduct."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
This active charity on the part of all who were about Luther is
his finest eulogium.</p>

<p>While the issue was anxiously waited for, the affair terminated
more easily than might have been supposed. The Legate de Vio,
chagrined at not having succeeded in the commission which he had
received to prepare a general war against the Turks, was desirous
to give lustre to his embassy in Germany by some other brilliant
exploit; and thinking that if he extinguished heresy he would reappear
at Rome with glory, he asked the pope to remit the affair
to him. Leo felt himself under obligation to Frederick, for having
so strenuously opposed the election of young Charles, and was
aware that he might still want his assistance. Accordingly, without
adverting to the citation, he charged his legate by a brief, dated
23rd of August, to examine the affair in Germany. The pope lost
nothing by this mode of proceeding; and, at the same time, if Luther
could be brought to a retractation, the noise and scandal which
his appearance at Rome might have occasioned were avoided.</p>

<p>"We charge you," said he, "to bring personally before you, to
pursue and constrain without delay, and as soon as you receive
this our letter, the said Luther, who has already been declared
heretic by our dear brother, Jerome, Bishop of Asculan."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Then the pope prescribes the severest measures against Luther.</p>

<p>"For this purpose invoke the arm and assistance of our very dear
son in Christ, Maximilian, the other princes of Germany, and all
its commonalties, universities, and powers ecclesiastical or secular;
and if you apprehend him, keep him in safe custody, in order that
he may be brought before us."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>We see that this indulgent concession of the pope was little else
than a surer method of dragging Luther to Rome. Next follow
the gentle measures:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If he returns to himself, and asks pardon for his great crime,
asks it of himself, and without being urged to do it, we give you
power to receive him into the unity of Holy Mother Church."</p>

<p>The pope soon returns to malediction.</p>

<p>"If he persists in his obstinacy, and you cannot make yourself
master of his person, we give you power to proscribe him in all
parts of Germany, to banish, curse, and excommunicate all who
are attached to him, and to order all Christians to shun their presence."</p>

<p>Still this is not enough. The pope continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>"And in order that this contagion maybe the more easily extirpated,
you will excommunicate all prelates, religious orders, communities,
counts, dukes, and grandees, except the Emperor Maximilian,
who shall refuse to seize the said Martin Luther and his
adherents, and send them to you, under due and sufficient guard.
And if (which God forbid) the said princes, communities, universities,
grandees, or any one belonging to them, offer an asylum to
the said Martin and his adherents, in any way, and give him, publicly
or in secret, by themselves or others, aid and counsel, we lay
under interdict these princes, communities, and grandees, with
their towns, burghs, fields, and villages, whither said Martin may
flee, as long as he shall remain there, and for three days after he
shall have left."</p>

<p>This audacious chair, which pretends to be the representative on
earth of Him who has said, <i>God sent not his Son into the world to
condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved</i>,
continues its anathemas; and, after having denounced penalties
against ecclesiastics, proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In regard to the laity, if they do not obey your orders instantly,
and without any opposition, we declare them infamous, (with
the exception of the most worthy Emperor,) incapable of performing
any lawful act, deprived of Christian burial, and stript of all
fiefs which they may hold, whether of the apostolic see, or of any
other superior whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Such was the fate which awaited Luther. The monarch of
Rome has leagued for his destruction, and to effect it, spared nothing,
not even the peace of the tomb. His ruin seems inevitable.
How will he escape this immense conspiracy? But Rome had miscalculated;
a movement produced by the Spirit of God was not to
be quelled by the decrees of its chancery.</p>

<p>Even the forms of a just and impartial inquest had not been observed.
Luther had been declared heretic, not only without having
been heard, but even before the expiry of the period named for his
compearance. The passions (and nowhere do they show themselves
stronger than in religious discussions) overleap all the forms of
justice. Strange proceedings, in this respect, occur, not only in
the Church of Rome, but in Protestant churches also, which have
turned aside from the gospel; in other words, in all places where
the truth is not, every thing done against the gospel is deemed
lawful. We often see men who, in any other case, would scruple
to commit the smallest injustice, not hesitating to trample under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
foot all forms and all rights when the matter in question is Christianity,
and the testimony borne to it.</p>

<p>When Luther was afterwards made acquainted with this brief,
he expressed his indignation. "Here," says he, "is the most remarkable
part of the whole affair. The brief is dated on the 23rd
of August, and I was cited for the 7th of August; so that between
the citation and the brief there is an interval of sixteen days.
Now, make the calculation, and you will find that my Lord Jerome,
Bishop of Asculan, has proceeded against me, given judgment, condemned,
and declared me heretic, before the citation could have
reached me, or at most sixteen days after it had been despatched
to me. Now, I ask, where are the sixty days given me in the citation?
They commenced on the 7th August, and were to end on
the 7th October. Is it the style and fashion of the court of Rome
to cite, admonish, accuse, judge, and pronounce sentence of condemnation,
all in one day, against a man who is at such a distance
from Rome, that he knows nothing at all of the proceedings?
What answer would they give to this? Doubtless, they forgot to
purge themselves with hellebore before proceeding to such falsehoods."<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>But at the same time that Rome was secretly depositing her
thunders in the hands of her legate, she was endeavouring, by
smooth and flattering words, to detach the prince whose power she
most dreaded from Luther's cause. The same day, 25th August
1518, the pope wrote the Elector of Saxony. Recurring to those
wiles of ancient policy which we have already pointed out, he endeavoured
to flatter the prince's self-love:</p>

<p>"Dear son," said the Roman pontiff, "when we think on your
noble and honourable race, and on yourself, its head and ornament;
when we recollect how you and your ancestors have always desired
to maintain Christian faith, and the honour and dignity of the Holy
See, we cannot believe that a man who abandons the faith can
trust to the favour of your Highness, in giving loose reins to his
wickedness. And yet it is told us from all quarters that a certain
friar, Martin Luther, Eremite of the order of St. Augustine, has,
like a child of malice, and a contemner of God, forgotten his habit
and his order, which consist in humility and obedience, and is boasting
that he fears neither the authority nor the punishment of any
man, because assured of your favour and protection.</p>

<p>"But, as we know that he is mistaken, we have thought good to
write to your Highness, and exhort you, according to the Lord, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
be vigilant for the honour of your name as a Christian prince, and
to defend yourself from these calumnies&mdash;yourself the ornament,
the glory, and sweet savour of your noble race&mdash;and to guard, not
only against a fault so grave as that which is imputed to you, but
also against even the suspicion which the insensate hardihood of
this friar tends to excite against you."</p>

<p>Leo X, at the same time, announced to Frederick that he had
charged Cardinal Saint Sixtus to examine the affair, and he enjoined
him to put Luther into the hands of the legate, "lest," added
he, returning again to his favourite argument, "lest the pious people
of our time, and of future times, may one day lament and say,
The most pernicious heresy with which the Church of God has
been afflicted was excited by the favour and support of this high
and honourable House."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Thus Rome had taken all her measures. With one hand she
diffused the perfume of praise, which is always so intoxicating,
while the other held terrors and vengeance.</p>

<p>All the powers of the earth, emperor, pope, princes, and legates,
began to move against this humble friar of Erfurt, whose internal
combats we have already traced. "<i>The kings of the earth stood
up, and the rulers took counsel together against the Lord and against
his anointed.</i>"</p>

<p>The letter and brief had not reached Germany, and Luther was
still fearing that he would be obliged to appear at Rome, when
a happy event gave comfort to his heart. He needed a friend to
whom he could unbosom his sorrows, and whose faithful love would
solace him in his hours of depression. All this God gave him in
Melancthon.</p>

<p>On the 14th February 1497, George Schwarzerd, a skilful
armour-master of Bretten, a small town in the Palatinate, had a
son born to him, who was named Philip, and who afterwards distinguished
himself under the name of Melancthon. Patronised by
the Palatine princes, and those of Bavaria and Saxony, George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was a man of unimpeachable integrity. He often refused the price
which purchasers offered him, and on learning that they were poor,
insisted on returning their money. He rose regularly at midnight,
and on his knees offered up a prayer. If on any occasion morning
arrived without his having done it, he felt dissatisfied with himself
the whole day. Barbara, Schwarzerd's wife, was daughter of an
honourable magistrate named John Reuter. She was of a gentle
temper, somewhat inclined to superstition, but otherwise remarkable
for wisdom and prudence. From her we have the old well-known
German rhymes&mdash;</p>

<p>Young Philip was not eleven when his father died. Two days
before, George called his son to his bed-side, and exhorted him to
have the thought of God always present. "I foresee," said the
dying armourer, "that dreadful storms are coming to shake the
world. I have seen great things, but greater are in preparation.
May God guide and direct you!" Philip, after receiving his father's
blessing, was sent to Spires, that he might not be present at his
death. He departed crying bitterly.</p>

<p>The young boy's grandfather, the worthy bailie Reuter, who had
also a son, acted as a father to him, and took him, together with
his brother, George, under his own roof. Shortly after he gave the
three boys for tutor John Hungarus, an excellent man, who afterwards,
and at a very advanced age, became a powerful preacher
of the gospel. He let nothing pass in the young man, punishing
him for every fault, yet with discretion. "In this way," says
Melancthon in 1554, "he made me a grammarian. He loved me
as a son, I loved him as a father, and we will meet, I trust, in
eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>Philip was remarkable for the excellence of his understanding,
and for his facility in learning, and expounding what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
learned. He could not endure idleness, and always sought out
some one with whom he might discuss what he had heard.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> It
often happened that educated strangers passed through Bretten,
and visited Reuter. The bailie's grandson instantly accosted them,
entered into conversation with them, and so pressed them in discussion
as to excite the wonder of those present. To a powerful
genius he joined great sweetness of temper, and was hence a general
favourite. He had a stammer, but, like the celebrated orator of
the Greeks, made such exertions to overcome it, that it afterwards
completely disappeared.</p>

<p>His grandfather having died, Philip was sent with his brother
and his young uncle, John, to the school of Pforzheim. The boys
resided with one of their relatives, the sister of the famous Reuchlin.
Eager for knowledge, Philip, under the tuition of George
Simler, made rapid progress in science, and especially in the study
of Greek, for which he had a real passion. Reuchlin often came to
Pforzheim, and having become acquainted with his sister's young
boarders, was soon struck with Philip's answers, and gave him
a Greek grammar and a Bible. These two books were to be the
study of his whole life.</p>

<p>When Reuchlin returned from his second journey into Italy, his
young relative, then twelve years of age, with some friends, performed
a Latin comedy of his own composition before him, in
honour of his arrival. Reuchlin, in raptures with the talents of
the youth, embraced him tenderly, called him his dear son, and
jocularly gave him the red bonnet which he had received on being
made doctor. It was at this time Reuchlin changed his name of
Schwarzerd into that of Melancthon. Both words, the one German,
and the other Greek, mean <i>black earth</i>. It was a general custom
with the learned thus to change their names into Greek or Latin.</p>

<p>Melancthon, at twelve, repaired to the university of Heidelberg,
and began to gratify his eager thirst for knowledge. He was admitted
Bachelor at fourteen. In 1512 Reuchlin invited him to
Tubingen, which contained a great number of distinguished literary
men. Here he attended at the same time lectures on theology,
medicine, and jurisprudence. There was no branch of knowledge
which he did not think it his duty to study. His object was not
praise, but the possession of science and the benefits of it.</p>

<p>The Holy Scriptures particularly occupied him. Those who frequented
the church of Tubingen had often observed a book in his
hands, which he studied between the services. This unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
volume seemed larger than the common prayer-books, and the
report spread that Philip when in church read profane books. It
turned out that the object of their suspicion was a copy of the Holy
Scriptures, printed a short time before at Bâsle by John Frobenius.
This volume he studied through life with unwearied application.
He had it always with him, carrying it to all the public meetings
to which he was invited.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Rejecting the vain system of the
schoolmen, he devoted himself to the simple word of the Gospel.
Erasmus at this time wrote to &OElig;colampadius, "Of Melancthon
I have the highest opinion, and the highest hopes. Jesus grant
that this young man may have a long life! He will completely
eclipse Erasmus."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Melancthon, nevertheless, shared in the errors
of his age. "I shudder," says he, in advanced life, "when I
think of the honour which I paid to images when I was still in the
papacy."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>In 1514, he was made doctor in philosophy, and began to teach.
His age was seventeen. The grace and attractiveness which he
gave to his lectures formed a striking contrast to the insipid method
which the doctors, and especially the monks, had hitherto pursued.
He took an active part in the combat in which Reuchlin was engaged
with the <i>Obscurants</i> of his age. His agreeable conversation, his
gentle and elegant manners, gaining him the love of all who knew
him, he soon acquired great authority, and a solid reputation in the
world.</p>

<p>At this time, the Elector Frederick having conceived the idea of
inviting some distinguished professor of ancient languages to his
university of Wittemberg, applied to Reuchlin who suggested Melancthon.
Frederick saw all the lustre which this young Hellenist
might shed on an institution which was so dear to him; and Reuchlin,
delighted at seeing so fine a field opened to his young friend, addressed
him in the words of Jehovah to Abraham,&mdash;"<i>Come out
from thy country, and thy kindred, and thy father's house, and I will
render thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.</i>" "Yes," continues
the old man, "I hope it will be so with thee, my dear Philip, my
work and my comfort."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> In this invitation, Melancthon saw a
call from God. The university was grieved to part with him, and
yet he was not without envious rivals and enemies. He left his
native country, exclaiming, "The will of the Lord be done." He
was then twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p>Melancthon made the journey on horseback, in company with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
some Saxon merchants, in the same way in which caravans travel
in the desert; for, says Reuchlin, he knew neither the towns nor
the roads.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> At Augsburg he did homage to the Elector, who happened
to be there. At Nuremberg he saw the excellent Pirckheimer,
whom he already knew, and at Leipsic formed an intimacy
with the learned Hellenist, Mosellanus. In this last town the
university gave a fete in honour of him. It was a truly academic
repast. The dishes were numerous, and as each made its appearance,
a professor rose and addressed Melancthon in a Latin discourse
previously prepared. He immediately gave an <i>extempore</i>
reply. At length, worn out with so much eloquence, "Most illustrious
friends," said he, "allow me to reply once for all to your
addresses; for not being prepared, I cannot put as much variety
into my replies as you into your addresses." Thereafter the dishes
arrived without the accompaniment of a discourse.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Reuchlin's young relative arrived at Wittemberg, 25th August,
1518, two days after Leo X had signed the brief addressed to Cajetan,
and the letter to the Elector.</p>

<p>The professors of Wittemberg did not receive Melancthon with
so much favour as those of Leipsic had done. The first impression
which he made upon them did not correspond to their expectations.
They saw a young man, who seemed still younger than he really
was, of small stature, and a feeble, timid air. Is this the illustrious
doctor whom the greatest men of the age, Erasmus and Reuchlin,
extol so loudly?... Neither Luther, with whom he first
was made acquainted, nor his colleagues, conceived high hopes
of him, when they saw his youth, his embarrassment, and whole
appearance.</p>

<p>Four days after his arrival (29th August) he delivered his inaugural
address. The whole university was assembled. The boy,
as Luther calls him,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> spoke such elegant Latin, and displayed so
much knowledge, a mind so cultivated, and a judgment so sound,
that all his hearers were filled with admiration.</p>

<p>At the termination of the address, all pressed forward to congratulate
him, but none felt more joy than Luther, who hastened to
communicate to his friends the feelings with which his heart was
overflowing. Writing Spalatin, 31st August, he says, "Melancthon,
four days after his arrival, delivered an address so beautiful
and so learned, that it was listened to with universal approbation
and astonishment. We have soon got the better of the prejudices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
which his stature and personal appearance had produced. We
praise and admire his eloquence; we thank the prince and you for
the service you have done us. I ask no other Greek master. But
I fear that his delicate body will not be able to digest our food,
and that, on account of the smallness of his salary, we shall not
keep him long. I hear that the Leipsic folks are already boasting
of being able to carry him off from us. Oh, my dear Spalatin, beware
of despising his age and personal appearance. He is a man
worthy of all honour.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Melancthon immediately began to explain Homer, and St. Paul's
Epistle to Titus. He was full of ardour. "I will do my utmost,"
wrote he to Spalatin, "to bring Wittemberg into favour with all
who love literature and virtue."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Four days after the inauguration,
Luther again wrote to Spalatin, "I recommend to you most
particularly the very learned and very amiable Greek, Philip. His
class-room is always full. All the theologians in particular attend
him. He sets all classes from the highest to the lowest, to the
learning of Greek."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Melancthon was able to return the affection of Luther, in whom
he soon discovered a goodness of heart, a strength of intellect, a
courage and a wisdom, which he had not previously found in any
man. He venerated and loved him. "If there is any one," said
he, "whom I love strongly, and whom my whole soul embraces, it
is Martin Luther."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>"Thus met Luther and Melancthon, and they were friends till
death. We cannot sufficiently admire the goodness and wisdom of
God in uniting two men so different, and yet so necessary to each
other. What Luther had in warmth, elasticity, and force, Melancthon
had in perspicuity, wisdom, and gentleness. Luther animated
Melancthon; Melancthon moderated Luther. They were like the
two forms of electric matter, the positive and the negative, which
modify each other. Had Luther been without Melancthon, the
stream had perhaps overflowed its bank; and, on the other hand,
Melancthon, when without Luther, hesitated, and even yielded,
where he ought to have stood firm.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Luther did much by vigour,
and Melancthon perhaps did not less by pursuing a slower and
calmer course. Both were upright, open, and generous, and both,
smitten with the love of the word of eternal life, served it with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
fidelity and devotedness which formed the distinguishing feature of
their lives.</p>

<p>The arrival of Melancthon produced a revolution, not only at
Wittemberg, but throughout Germany and the learned world. His
study of the Greek and Latin classics, and of philosophy, had given
him an order, perspicuity, and precision of thought, which shed
new light and inexpressible beauty on all the subjects which he
discussed. The mild spirit of the gospel fertilized and enlivened
his meditations, and the driest subjects when he expounded them
were invested with a grace which fascinated all his hearers. The
sterility which scholasticism had spread over education ceased, and
a new mode of instruction and study commenced. "Thanks to
Melancthon," says a distinguished German historian, "Wittemberg
became the national school."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>It was, indeed, of great importance, that a man thoroughly
versed in Greek should teach in this university, where the new
developments of theology called masters and scholars to study
the primitive documents of the Christian faith in the original
languages. Thenceforth Luther set himself zealously to this task.
Often did the meaning of a Greek term, which had previously been
unknown to him, throw sudden light on his theological views. For
example, how great his satisfaction and delight when he saw that
the Greek word, &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;, which according to the Latin church,
meant a penance, a satisfaction enacted by the Church, meant in
Greek a transformation or conversion of heart. A thick mist all
at once disappeared from before his eyes. The two meanings given
to this word are sufficient to characterise the two churches.</p>

<p>The impulse which Melancthon gave to Luther, in regard to the
translation of the Bible, is one of the most remarkable circumstances
in the friendship of these two great men. As early as
1517, Luther had made some attempts at translation, and procured
as many Greek and Latin books as he could. Now, aided
by his dear Philip, his task received a new impetus. Luther
obliged Melancthon to take part in his researches, by consulting
him on difficult passages, and the work, destined to be one of the
greatest works of the Reformer, advanced more surely and more
rapidly.</p>

<p>Melancthon, on his part, became acquainted with a new theology.
The beautiful and profound doctrine of justification by faith filled
him with astonishment and joy. Still, in receiving the system
Luther professed, he acted independently, moulding it according
to the particular form of his own intellect; for, although he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
only twenty-one years of age, he was one of those precocious minds
which enter early into possession of all their powers, and are themselves
from the very outset.</p>

<p>The zeal of the masters was soon transfused into the scholars.
It was proposed to reform the course of study. With the concurrence
of the Elector, certain branches, only of scholastic importance,
were suppressed, and at the same time a new impulse was given
to classic pursuits. The school of Wittemberg underwent a transformation,
and the contrast between it and other universities became
still more prominent. Still, however, the landmarks of the
Church were observed, though all felt that they were on the eve of
a great battle with the pope.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Sentiments of Luther and Staupitz&mdash;Order to Appear&mdash;Alarms and Courage&mdash;The
Elector with the Legate&mdash;Departure for Augsburg&mdash;Sojourn at Weimar&mdash;Nuremberg.</p></blockquote>


<p>The arrival of Melancthon, doubtless, gave a pleasant turn to
Luther's thoughts at this very critical moment; and, doubtless, in
the sweet intercourse of a growing friendship, and amid the biblical
labours to which he devoted himself with new zeal, he sometimes
forgot Prierio, Leo, and the ecclesiastical court before which he
behoved to plead. Still, these were only fleeting moments, and his
thoughts were ever recurring to the formidable tribunal before
which implacable enemies had summoned him to appear. What
terrors would not this thought have thrown into a mind which was
seeking aught else than the truth! But Luther trembled not!
Confiding fully in the faithfulness and power of God, he remained
firm, and was quite ready to expose himself single-handed to the
rage of enemies mightier than those who had lighted the fire for
John Huss.</p>

<p>A few days after the arrival of Melancthon, and before the
pope's resolution transferring the citation of Luther from Rome to
Augsburg could be known, Luther wrote Spalatin:&mdash;"I ask not
our sovereign to do any thing whatever for the defence of my theses.
I am willing to be delivered up and thrown single into the hands
of my adversaries. Let him allow the whole storm to burst upon
me. What I have undertaken to defend, I hope I shall be able,
with the assistance of Christ, to maintain. Violence, indeed, must
be submitted to; but still without abandoning the truth."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
The courage of Luther communicated itself to others. Men of
the greatest gentleness and timidity, on seeing the danger which
threatened the witness for the truth, found words full of energy and
indignation. The prudent and pacific Staupitz, on the 7th September,
wrote to Spalatin: "Cease not to exhort the prince, your
master and mine, not to be alarmed at the roaring of the lions.
Let him defend the truth without troubling himself about Luther,
or Staupitz, or the order. Let there be a place where men can
speak freely and without fear. I know that the plague of Babylon&mdash;I
had almost said of Rome&mdash;breaks forth against all who attack
the abuses of those traffickers in Jesus Christ. I have myself seen
a preacher of the truth thrown headlong from the pulpit; I have
seen him, though on a festival, bound and dragged to a dungeon.
Others have seen still greater cruelties. Therefore, my dear friend,
strive to make his Highness persevere in his sentiments."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The order to appear at Augsburg before the cardinal legate at
length arrived. Luther had now to do with one of the princes of
the Church. All his friends entreated him not to go.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> They feared
that on the journey snares might be laid for him, and an attempt
made on his life. Some employed themselves in looking out for an
asylum to him. Staupitz himself, the timid Staupitz, felt moved at
the thought of the dangers which threatened that friar Martin
whom he had drawn from the obscurity of the cloister, and placed
on the troubled stage where his life was now in peril. Ah! would
it not have been better if the poor friar had remained for ever unknown?
It was too late. Still, at least, he would do everything
to save him. Accordingly, on the 15th September he wrote him
from his convent of Salzburg, urging him to flee and seek an asylum
beside himself. "It seems to me," said he, "that the whole world
is enraged, and in coalition against the truth. In the same way
crucified Jesus was hated. I see not that you have anything to
expect but persecution. Shortly, no man will be able without the
permission of the pope, to sound the Scriptures, and search for
Jesus Christ in them, though this Christ himself enjoins. You
have only a few friends; and would to God that the fear of your
adversaries did not prevent those few from declaring in your favour.
The wisest course is to quit Wittemberg for a time and come to
me. Thus we will live and die together. This is also the prince's
opinion," adds Staupitz.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>From different quarters Luther received the most alarming notices.
Count Albert of Mansfeld sent a message to him to beware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of setting out, for some great barons had sworn to make themselves
masters of his person, and to strangle or drown him.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> But nothing
could deter him. He never thought of availing himself of the
vicar-general's offer. He will not go and hide himself in the obscurity
of the convent of Salzburg, but will faithfully remain on the
stormy scene on which the hand of God has placed him. It is by
persevering in the face of adversaries, and proclaiming the truth
with loud voice in the midst of the world, that the reign of truth
advances. Why, then, should he flee? He is not one of "those
who draw back to perdition; but of those who believe to the saving
of the soul." The words of the Master whom he serves, and loves
better than life, are incessantly echoing in his heart, "<i>Whosoever
will confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father
who is in heaven.</i>" In Luther and in the Reformation we uniformly
meet with that intrepid courage, that high-toned morality, that
boundless charity, which the first preaching of Christianity manifested
to the world. "I am like Jeremiah," says Luther, at the
period of which we are now speaking; "Jeremiah, the man of
quarrel and discord; but the more they multiply their menaces the
more they increase my joy. My wife and children are well provided,
(of course, meaning he had none;) my fields, my houses,
and all my goods, are in order.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> They have already torn my honour
and my reputation to shreds. The only thing left me is my
poor body, and let them take it; they will only shorten my life
some few hours. My soul they cannot take from me. He who
would publish the word of Christ in the world must expect death
every hour; for our bridegroom is a bridegroom of blood."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>The Elector was then at Augsburg. A short time before quitting
that town after the Diet, he had of his own accord paid a visit to
the legate. The cardinal, greatly flattered by this mark of respect
from so illustrious a prince, promised that if the monk presented
himself he would listen to him like a father, and kindly dismiss
him. Spalatin, on the part of the prince, wrote to his friend that
the pope had named a commission to try him in Germany; that
the Elector would not allow him to be dragged to Rome; and that
he must prepare to set out for Augsburg. Luther resolved to obey;
but the warning which he had received from Count Mansfeld made
him apply to Frederick for a safe-conduct. Frederick replied that
it was unnecessary, and merely gave him recommendations to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of the leading counsellors of Augsburg. He also sent him some
money for the journey. The Reformer, poor and defenceless, set
out on foot to place himself in the hands of his adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>What must have been his feelings on quitting Wittemberg, and
directing his steps towards Augsburg, where the legate of the pope
was waiting for him! The object of this journey was not like that
of Heidelberg, a friendly meeting. He was going to appear in presence
of the legate of Rome without a safe-conduct; perhaps he
was going to death. But in him faith was not a mere matter of
show. Being a reality it gave him peace, and in the name of the
Lord of Hosts he could advance without fear to bear testimony to
the Gospel.</p>

<p>He arrived at Weimar on the 28th of September, and lodged in
the convent of the Cordeliers. One of the monks was unable to
withdraw his eyes from him. It was Myconius. This was the first
time he had seen Luther, and he longed to approach him, and tell
that he owed the peace of his soul to him, and that his whole desire
was to labour with him. But Myconius being closely watched
by his superiors, was not permitted to speak to Luther.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The elector of Saxony was then holding his court at Weimar, and
this is probably the reason why the Cordeliers gave admittance to
the doctor. The day after his arrival the feast of St. Michael was
celebrated. Luther said mass, and was even invited to preach in
the church of the castle. It was a mark of favour which the prince
wished to give him. He, accordingly, in presence of the court,
preached a long sermon, on the text of the day, which is taken
from the Gospel of St. Matthew, (chap, xviii, 1-11.) He spoke
forcibly against hypocrites, and those who boast of their own righteousness;
but he did not speak of the angels, though this was the
customary topic on St. Michael's day.</p>

<p>The courage of the doctor of Wittemberg, in calmly setting out
on foot to obey a summons, which in the case of so many before
him had issued in death, astonished those who saw him. Interest,
admiration, and compassion, succeeded each other in their minds.
John Kestner, superintendant to the Cordeliers, alarmed at the idea
of the dangers which awaited his guest, said to him, "Brother, you
will find at Augsburg Italians, men of learning, and subtle antagonists,
who will give you much to do. I fear you will not be
able to defend your cause against them. They will cast you into
the fire, and with their flames consume you."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Luther replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
gravely, "Dear friend, pray to our Lord God, who is in heaven,
and present a <i>Pater noster</i> for me, and his dear child, Jesus, whose
cause my cause is, that he may be gracious toward me. If he
maintain his cause, mine is maintained. But if he pleases not to
maintain it, assuredly it is not I who can maintain it; and it is he
who will bear the affront."</p>

<p>Luther continued his journey on foot, and arrived at Nuremberg.
He was going to present himself before a prince of the Church, and
wished his dress to be suitable; but his clothes were old, and, besides,
had suffered much by the journey. He borrowed a frock
from his faithful friend, Winceslaus Link, preacher at Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Luther, doubtless, did not confine his visit to Link, but also saw
his other friends in Nuremberg, secretary Scheurl, the celebrated
painter, Albert Durer, to whom Nuremberg is now erecting a statue,
and many others. He strengthened himself by intercourse
with the excellent of the earth, while many monks and laymen expressed
alarm, and endeavoured to shake him by representing the
difficulties in his way. Letters which he wrote from this town
show the spirit by which he was animated. "I have met," says
he, "with pusillanimous men, who would persuade me not to go to
Augsburg; but I have determined on going. The will of the Lord
be done. Even at Augsburg, even in the midst of his enemies,
Jesus Christ reigns. Let Christ live; let Luther and every sinner
die. According as it is written: Let the God of my salvation be
exalted! Behave well, persevere, stand firm; for we must not be
reproved either by men or by God; God is true, and man a liar."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Link and an Augustin monk could not consent to allow Luther
to travel alone and meet the dangers which threatened him. They
were acquainted with his bold and fearless character, and suspected
he would fail in due precaution. They, therefore, accompanied
him. When they were about five leagues from Augsburg, Luther,
exhausted, no doubt, by the fatigue of travelling, and the varied
emotions of his heart, was seized with violent pains in the stomach.
He thought he was dying, and his friends becoming very uneasy,
hired a car to transport him. They arrived at Augsburg on the
evening of Friday the 7th of October, and lighted at the Augustin
convent. Luther was greatly fatigued, but soon recovered; his
faith and mental energy speedily recruiting his exhausted body.</p>

<p>The instant he was at Augsburg, and before he had seen any
one, Luther, wishing to pay all due respect to the legate, begged
Winceslaus Link to go and announce his arrival. Link did so, and
humbly declared to the cardinal, on the part of the doctor of Wittemberg,
that he was ready to appear at his order. The legate
was delighted with the news. At last he had a hold of this boisterous
heretic, who, he assured himself, would not quit the walls
of Augsburg as he had entered. At the same time, when Link
went to the legate, the monk Leonard set out to announce Luther's
arrival to Staupitz. The vicar-general had written the doctor,
that he would certainly come as soon as he should know of his
being in the town, and Luther was unwilling to lose an instant in
giving him intimation.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The Diet was closed, and the Emperor and the electors had already
separated. The Emperor, it is true, had not left but was
hunting in the neighbourhood. The ambassador of Rome was thus
at Augsburg alone. Had Luther come during the Diet, he would
have found powerful protectors, but now it seemed that every thing
must bend under the weight of papal authority.</p>

<p>The name of the judge before whom Luther had to appear was
not fitted to increase his confidence. Thomas de Vio surnamed
Cajetan, from the town of Gaeta, in the kingdom of Naples, where
he was born, had, from his youth, given great hopes. Having
at sixteen entered the Dominican order, against the express
wish of his parents, he afterwards became general of his order,
and a cardinal of the Roman Church. But what was worse for
Luther, this learned doctor was one of the most zealous defenders
of the scholastic theology, which the Reformer had always treated
so unmercifully. His mother was said to have dreamt during her
pregnancy, that St. Thomas would in person educate the child to
which she was to give birth, and introduce him to heaven. Hence
De Vio, on becoming Dominican, had changed his name from
James to Thomas. He had zealously defended the prerogatives of
the papacy, and the doctrines of Thomas Aquinas, whom he regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
as the most perfect of theologians.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> A lover of pomp and
show, he almost gave a literal meaning to the Roman maxim that
legates are above kings, and surrounded himself with great state.
On the first of August, he had celebrated a solemn mass in the
cathedral of Augsburg, and in presence of all the princes of the
empire, had placed the cardinal's hat on the head of the Archbishop
of Mentz while kneeling before the altar, and had delivered
to the Emperor himself the hat and sword consecrated by
the pope. Such was the man before whom the monk of Wittemberg
was going to appear, clothed in a frock which was not even
his own. Besides, the acquirements of the legate, the austerity of
his disposition, and the purity of his morals, gave him in Germany
an influence and authority which other Roman courtiers would
not have easily obtained. To this reputation for sanctity he
doubtless owed his mission. Rome saw that he would serve her
purposes admirably. Thus the personal qualities of Cajetan made
him still more formidable. Moreover, the business entrusted to
him was not complicated. Luther had already been declared a
heretic.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> If he refused to retract, the duty of the legate was to
put him in prison; or if he escaped, to launch excommunication
at every one who should dare to give him an asylum. This was
all that Rome required to be done by the legate before whom
Luther was cited.<a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Luther had recovered strength during the night, and on
Saturday morning 8th October, being somewhat rested from his
journey, began to consider his strange situation. He felt resigned,
and waited till the will of God should be manifested by
the event. He had not long to wait. A personage who was unknown
to him sent in a message, as if he had been entirely devoted
to his service, to say that he was coming to wait upon him,
and that Luther must take good care not to appear before the
legate without having seen him. This message came from an
Italian named Urban of Serra-Longa, who had often been in Germany,
as envoy of the Margrave of Montferrat. He was known
to the Elector of Saxony, to whom he had been accredited, and
after the death of the Margrave had attached himself to Cardinal
de Vio.</p>

<p>The finesse and manners of this man formed a very striking
contrast to the noble frankness and generous integrity of Luther.
The Italian shortly after arrived at the Augustin convent. The
cardinal had sent him to sound the Reformer, and prepare him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the retractation which he was expected to make. Serra-Longa
imagined that his residence in Germany gave him great advantages
over the other courtiers in the suite of the legate, and he
hoped to have good sport with the German monk.</p>

<p>He arrived attended by two servants, and pretended to have
come of his own accord, because of the friendship which he felt
for a favourite of the Elector of Saxony, and because of his attachment
to the Holy Church. After paying his respects to Luther
in the warmest terms, the diplomatist added, in an affectionate
manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I come to give you sage and good advice. Re-attach yourself
to the Church. Submit unreservedly to the cardinal. Retract
your injurious expressions. Remember the Abbot Joachim
of Florence. He, you know, had said heretical things, and yet
was declared not heretical, because he retracted his errors."</p>

<p>Luther spoke of defending himself.</p>

<p><i>Serra-Longa.</i>&mdash;"Beware of doing so!... Would you pretend
to fight with the legate of his holiness, as if you were tilting at a
tournay?"</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"When it is proved that I have taught anything contrary
to the Roman Church I will pass judgment on myself, and
retract instantly. The whole question will be, Whether the legate
leans more upon St. Thomas than the faith authorises him to do?
If he does, I will not yield to him."</p>

<p><i>Serra-Longa.</i>&mdash;"Ah! Ah! Do you pretend, then, to break
lances?"</p>

<p>Then the Italian began to say things which Luther designates
horrible. He pretended that false propositions might be maintained,
provided they produced money and filled the strong box&mdash;that
the universities must take good care not to dispute on the
authority of the pope&mdash;that their duty, on the contrary, was to
maintain that the pope can, at his beck, alter or suppress articles
of faith;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> adding other things of the same nature. But the wily
Italian soon perceived that he was forgetting himself. Returning
to soft words, he strove to persuade Luther to submit to the
legate in every thing, and retract his doctrines, his oaths, and his
theses.</p>

<p>The doctor, who, at the outset, had given some credit to the
fine protestations of orator Urban, (as he designates him in his
account of the interview,) was now convinced that they were of
very little value, and that Serra-Longa was much more on the
legate's side than on his. He, therefore, became less communicative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and contented himself with saying that he was quite disposed
to exercise humility, give proof of obedience, and make satisfaction
in whatever matters he had been mistaken. At these
words Serra-Longa, overjoyed, exclaimed, "I am off to the legate,
and you will follow me; everything will go off most admirably; it
will be soon finished...."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>He went off. The Saxon monk, who had more discernment
than the Roman courtier, thought within himself, "This wily
Sinon has come along ill-prepared and ill-instructed by his
Greeks."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Luther was suspended between hope and fear; hope,
however, predominating. The visit and the strange assertions of
Serra-Longa, whom at a later period he calls an inexpert mediator,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
made him resume courage.</p>

<p>The counsellors and other inhabitants of Augsburg, to whom
the Elector had recommended Luther, hastened to visit the monk,
whose name was now resounding throughout all Germany. Peutinger,
counsellor of the empire, who was one of the most distinguished
patricians of the town, and often invited Luther to his table,
counsellor Langemantel, Dr. Auerbach of Leipsic, the two brothers
Adelmann, both canons, and several others besides, repaired
to the convent of the Augustins, and gave a cordial welcome
to the extraordinary man, who had journeyed so far to come and
place himself in the hands of the creatures of Rome. "Have
you a safe-conduct?" they asked. "No!" replied the intrepid
monk. "What hardihood!" exclaimed they. "It was, indeed,"
says Luther, "a fit term to designate my rash folly." All with
one voice entreated him not to go to the legate until he had
obtained a safe-conduct from the Emperor himself. It is probable
that the public had already heard of the papal brief of which the
legate was the bearer.</p>

<p>"But," replied Luther, "I came to Augsburg without a safe-conduct,
and have arrived in good health."</p>

<p>"The Elector having recommended you to us, you ought to
obey us, and do what we tell you," rejoined Langemantel, kindly
but firmly. Dr. Auerbach seconded his remonstrances. "We
know," says he, "that the cardinal, at the bottom of his heart, is
in the highest degree incensed against you.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> No trust can be put
in the Italians."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>Canon Adelmann likewise insisted, "You have been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
defenceless, and it has been forgotten to furnish you with the
precise thing which you required."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> These friends engaged to
obtain the necessary safe-conduct from the Emperor. They afterwards
told Luther how many persons even of elevated rank, were
inclined in his favour. "Even the minister of France, who quitted
Augsburg a few days ago, spoke of you in the most honourable
terms."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> This statement struck Luther, and he afterwards
remembered it. Thus, the most respectable citizens in one of the
first cities of the empire were already gained to the Reformation.</p>

<p>They were still conversing when Serra-Longa re-appeared.
"Come," said he to Luther, "the cardinal is waiting for you and I
myself am going to conduct you to his presence. Listen while
I tell you how you are to appear. When you enter the hall
where he is, you will prostrate yourself before him with your
face on the ground; when he tells you to rise, you will get up on
your knees, and not stand erect, but wait till he bids you.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Recollect
that it is before a prince of the Church that you are going
to appear. For the rest fear nothing; the whole will be finished
soon, and without difficulty."</p>

<p>Luther, who had promised this Italian that he would be ready
to follow at his call, felt embarrassed. Yet he hesitated not to
inform him of the advice which he had received from his Augsburg
friends, and spoke to him of a safe-conduct.</p>

<p>"Beware of asking one," immediately replied Serra-Longa; "you
have no need of it. The legate is well-disposed, and quite ready
to finish the thing amicably. If you ask a safe-conduct you will
totally spoil your affair."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>"My gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony," replied Luther,
"has recommended me to several honourable men of this town,
who counsel me to undertake nothing without a safe-conduct. I
must follow their advice, for, were I not to do so, and were anything
to happen, they would write to the Elector, my master, that
I had refused to listen to them."</p>

<p>Luther persisted in his resolution, and Serra-Longa saw himself
obliged to return to his chief, to announce the obstacle which his
mission had encountered at the moment when he was flattering
himself with seeing it crowned with success.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the conferences of that day with the orator of
Montferrat.</p>

<p>Another invitation was given to Luther. John Frosch, the prior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the Carmelites, who was an old friend of his, and two years before,
as a licentiate of theology, had maintained theses under the
presidency of Luther, paid him a visit, and earnestly begged he
would come and reside with him. He claimed the honour of having
the doctor of Germany for his guest. Men at length feared not to
do homage to him in presence of Rome; the feeble had already
become strong. Luther accepted, and left the Augustin convent
for that of the Carmelites. The day did not close without
serious reflection. The eagerness of Serra-Longa, and the fears of
the counsellors, equally served to acquaint him with the difficulty
of his position. Nevertheless, God in heaven was his protector,
and under his guardianship he could sleep without fear.</p>

<p>The next day, being Sunday,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> gave him somewhat more repose.
He had, however, to endure a different kind of fatigue. The
whole talk of the town was about Dr. Luther, and, as Melancthon
expresses it, every body was desirous to see "this new Erostratus,
who had kindled so immense a conflagration."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The people
pressed around him, and the good doctor, no doubt smiled at their
eagerness.</p>

<p>But he had to submit to another kind of importunity. If the
people were desirous to see him, they were still more so to hear
him, and he was requested on all hands to preach. Luther had
no greater delight than in proclaiming the word, and would have
been happy to preach Jesus Christ in this great city, in the solemn
circumstances in which he was placed. But on this occasion, as
on many others, he showed a strong sense of propriety, and profound
respect for his superiors, and refused to preach, lest the
legate might suppose that he did it in order to give him pain, and
by way of defiance. This moderation and wisdom were undoubtedly
of as much value as a sermon.</p>

<p>The cardinal's creatures, however, did not leave him in tranquillity,
but returned to the charge. "The Cardinal," said they,
"assures you of his entire grace and favour. What do you fear?"
They alleged a thousand reasons in order to induce him to go.
"He is a father full of mercy, said one of these envoys; but another
approaching, whispered in his ear, "Don't believe what
is told you&mdash;he does not keep his word."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Luther adhered to his
resolution.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, 10th October, Serra-Longa returned to
the charge. The courtier had made it a point of honour to succeed
in his negotiation. As soon as he entered, he exclaimed in Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
"Why do you not come to the cardinal? He is waiting for you
with the most indulgent feelings. The whole matter may be
summed up in six letters:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Revoca</span>, Retract. Come, you have
nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Luther thought within himself, these six are important letters;
but, without entering into discussion on the subject, said, "As
soon as I have obtained the safe-conduct I will appear."</p>

<p>Serra-Longa broke out on hearing these words. He insisted,
and remonstrated, but found Luther immovable. Becoming more
and more irritated, he exclaimed, "You imagine, doubtless, that
the Elector will take up arms in your behalf, and for your sake
run the risk of losing the territories handed down to him from his
fathers."</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"God forbid."</p>

<p><i>Serra-Longa.</i>&mdash;"Abandoned by all, where will your refuge be?"</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;(<i>Looking upwards with the eye of faith</i>,) "Under heaven."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Serra-Longa, struck with this sublime reply, for which he
was not prepared, remained a moment silent, and then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What would you do if you had the pope, the legate, and all the
cardinals, in your hands, as they have you in theirs?"</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"I would pay them all honour and respect. But in
my view, the word of God takes precedence of all."</p>

<p><i>Serra-Longa.</i>&mdash;(<i>Laughing, and wagging one of his fingers as the
Italians do.</i>) "Hem! Hem! all honour ... I don't believe a
word of it...."</p>

<p>He then went out, leapt into his saddle, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Serra-Longa returned no more to Luther; but he long remembered
both the resistance which he had met with from the Reformer,
and that which his master also was soon to experience.
At a later period, we shall see him with loud cries demanding
Luther's blood.</p>

<p>Serra-Longa had not long left the doctor when the safe-conduct
arrived. His friends had obtained it from the counsellor of the
empire, who, it is probable, had previously consulted with the
Emperor, as he was not far from Augsburg. It would even seem,
from a remark afterwards made by the cardinals that, to avoid
offending him, his consent had been asked. This may have been
his reason for employing Serra-Longa to work upon Luther; for
to have openly opposed the giving of a safe-conduct would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
been to reveal intentions which he was desirous to conceal. It
was safer to induce Luther himself to desist from his demand. It
was soon seen, however, that the Saxon monk was not made of
pliable materials.</p>

<p>Luther is going to appear. While demanding a safe-conduct,
he did not trust to a carnal arm; for he knew very well that a
safe-conduct did not save John Huss from the flames. He only
wished to do his duty by submitting to the advice of his master's
friends. Jehovah will decide. If he requires him to give back
his life, he is ready to give it joyfully. At this solemn moment,
he feels a longing for converse with his friends, especially with
Melancthon, now so dear to his heart, and avails himself of a moment
of retirement to write him.</p>

<p>"Comport yourself like a man," says he to him, "as you always
do. Teach our dear youth what is right and agreeable to
God. For me, I am ready to be sacrificed for you and for them,
if it is the Lord's will.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Sooner than retract what I was bound to
teach, I would die, and even (what would be to me the greatest
misfortune) be deprived for ever of your delightful society, thus
losing (perhaps by my fault) the excellent studies to which we are
now devoted.</p>

<p>"Italy, like Egypt of old, is plunged in darkness, so thick that
it may be felt. Nobody knows anything of Christ, or of what
relates to him; and yet these people are our lords and masters in
faith and manners. Thus the wrath of God is fulfilled upon us,
as the prophet speaks: '<i>I will give them youths for governors, and
babes will rule over them.</i>' Conduct yourself as in presence of the
Lord, my dear Philip, and avert the divine wrath by pure and
fervent prayer."</p>

<p>The legate, informed that Luther was next day to appear before
him, assembled the Italians and Germans, in whom he had
the greatest confidence, in order to consider what was necessary
to be done with the Saxon monk. Opinions were divided. "He
must," says one, "be compelled to retract." "He must be
seized," says another, "and imprisoned." A third thought that it
was better to get quit of him; and a fourth that an attempt should
be made to gain him by kindness and lenity. This last advice the
cardinal seems at first to have determined to adopt.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">First appearance&mdash;First Words&mdash;Conditions of Rome&mdash;Propositions to Retract&mdash;Luther's
reply&mdash;He withdraws&mdash;Impressions on both sides&mdash;Arrival of Staupitz.</p></blockquote>


<p>The day of conference at length arrived.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The legate, knowing
that Luther had declared his readiness to retract what could be
proved contrary to the truth, had great hopes of success. He
doubted not that it would be easy for a man of his rank and knowledge
to bring back this monk to the obedience of the Church.</p>

<p>Luther repaired to the legate, accompanied by the prior of the
Carmelites, (his host and friend,) two friars of the convent, Dr.
Link, and an Augustin, probably the one who had come with
him from Nuremberg. Scarcely had he entered the palace of the
legate, than all the Italians in the suite of the prince of the Church
rushed forward. Every one wished to see the famous doctor, and
pressed so upon him that he could scarcely advance. Luther found
the Apostolical Nuncio, and Serra-Longa, in the hall where the
cardinal was waiting. The reception was cold but polite, and
conformable to Roman etiquette. Luther, following the instructions
which Serra-Longa had given him, prostrated himself before the
cardinal; when told to rise, he put himself on his knees; and, on
a new order from the legate, stood erect. Several of the most
distinguished Italians in the service of the legate pushed forward
into the hall to be present at the interview. They desired above
all to see the German monk humbling himself before the representative
of the pope.</p>

<p>The legate remained silent. Hating Luther as an adversary of
the theological supremacy of St. Thomas, and as the head of an
active opposition in a rising university, whose very first steps had
greatly disquieted the Thomists, he was pleased at seeing him lying
before him, and thought, says a contemporary, that Luther was
going to sing a palinode. Luther, on his part, waited till the prince
should address him; but seeing he did not, he took his silence for
an invitation to begin, and spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Most Worthy Father</span>,&mdash;On the citation of his Papal Holiness,
and at the request of my most gracious lord, the Elector of
Saxony, I appear before you as a submissive and obedient son of
the holy Christian Church, and I acknowledge that I published the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Propositions and Theses in question. I am ready to listen in all
obedience to the charge brought against me, and to allow myself,
if I am mistaken, to be instructed in the way of truth."</p>

<p>The cardinal, who had resolved to assume the air of a tender
father, full of compassion for an erring child, now spoke in the
most friendly tone, praised the humility of Luther, expressed all
the joy it gave him, and said:&mdash;"My dear son, you have stirred
up all Germany by your dispute on indulgences. I am told that
you are a very learned doctor in the Scriptures, and have many
disciples. Wherefore, if you would be a member of the Church,
and find in the pope a most gracious lord, listen to me."</p>

<p>After this exordium, the legate did not hesitate to disclose to
him at once all that he expected of him&mdash;so confident was he of
his submission. "Here," said he, "are three articles which, by the
order of our most holy father, Leo X, I have to lay before you;
<i>First</i>, You must retrace your steps, acknowledge your faults, and
retract your errors, propositions, and discourses: <i>Secondly</i>, You
must promise to abstain in future from circulating your opinions;
and, <i>Thirdly</i>, You must engage to be more moderate, and to avoid
every thing that might grieve or upset the Church."</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"I request, most worthy father, that you will communicate
to me the brief of the pope, in virtue of which you have
received full power to dispose of this affair."</p>

<p>Serra-Longa, and the other Italians in the cardinal's suite, stared
on hearing this request; and although the German monk had
already appeared to them a very odd man, they could scarcely
recover from the astonishment produced by so bold a speech.
Christians, accustomed to ideas of justice, desire just procedure in
the case of others as well as of themselves, but those who act habitually
in an arbitrary manner are quite surprised when they are
told to proceed in regular form, according to law.</p>

<p><i>De Vio.</i>&mdash;"This request, my dear son, cannot be granted. You
must acknowledge your errors, take care of your words in future,
and not return to your vomit, so that we may be able to sleep
without trouble and anxiety; thereafter, conformably to the order
and authority of our most holy father the pope, I will arrange
the affair."</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"Have the goodness, then, to tell me in what I have
erred."</p>

<p>At this new request the Italian courtiers, who had expected to
see the poor German on his knees crying mercy, were struck with
still greater astonishment. Not one of them would have thought
of condescending so far as to answer so impertinent a question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
But De Vio, who considered it ungenerous to crush the cative
monk with the whole weight of his authority, and who, besides, was
confident that his superior knowledge would give him an easy victory,
consented to tell Luther of what he was accused, and even
to enter into discussion with him. In justice to this general of
the Dominicans, it must be admitted that he had more equity, a
better sense of propriety, and less passion, than have been shown
on many occasions since, in similar affairs. He assumed a tone of
condescension, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very dear son!&mdash;Here are two propositions which you
have advanced, and which you must first of all retract: <i>First</i>,
The treasury of indulgences does not consist of the merits and
sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ: <i>Second</i>, The man who receives
the Holy Sacrament must have faith in the grace which is
offered to him."</p>

<p>In fact, both of these propositions gave a mortal blow to the
Roman traffic. If the pope had not the power to dispose at pleasure
of the merits of the Saviour; if those who received the bills
which the courtiers of the Church were negotiating did not
receive part of this infinite righteousness, the paper lost all its
value, and was worth no more than if it had been blank. It was
the same with the sacraments. Indulgences were to some extent
an extraordinary branch of the commerce of Rome, whereas the
sacraments were of the nature of an ordinary branch. The
returns which they yielded were far from being insignificant. To
maintain that faith was necessary before the sacraments could
confer a real benefit on a Christian soul, was to deprive them of
all interest in the eyes of the people; faith being a thing which
the pope did not give, which was beyond his power, and came
from God only. To declare it necessary was to wrest out of the
hands of Rome both speculation and profit. Luther, in attacking
these two dogmas, had imitated Jesus Christ, when at the
commencement of his ministry he overthrew the tables of the
money-changers, and drove the buyers and sellers out of the
temple, saying, <i>Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise</i>.</p>

<p>"I will not, in order to combat these errors," continued Cajetan,
"invoke the authority of St. Thomas and the other scholastic doctors;
I will found only on the authority of Holy Scripture, and
speak with you in all friendship."</p>

<p>But scarcely had De Vio begun to unfold his proofs than he
deviated from the rule which he had declared his intention to
follow.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> He combated Luther's first proposition by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
extravagant<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> of Pope Clement, and the second by all sorts of scholastic
dogmas. The discussion commenced on this constitution of the pope
in favour of indulgences. Luther, indignant at the authority which
the legate ascribed to a decree of Rome, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot receive such constitutions as sufficient proofs in so
important matters. For they wrest the Holy Scripture, and never
quote it appositely."</p>

<p><i>De Vio.</i>&mdash;"The pope has authority and power over all
things."</p>

<p><i>Luther, (keenly.)</i>&mdash;"Save Scripture."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p><i>De Vio, (ironically.)</i>&mdash;"Save Scripture!... The pope, know
you not, is above Councils? Even recently he condemned and
punished the Council of Bâsle."</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"The university of Paris appealed."</p>

<p><i>De Vio.</i>&mdash;"These Parisian gentry will pay the penalty."</p>

<p>The discussion between the cardinal and Luther afterwards
turned on the second point, viz., on faith. This Luther declared
to be necessary, in order to receive benefit from the sacraments,
and, according to his custom, quoted several passages of Scripture
in favour of the opinion which he maintained, but the legate
received them with loud laughter. "It is of general faith you
speak, then," said he.&mdash;"No!" replied Luther. One of the
Italians, master of the ceremonies to the legate, out of all
patience at Luther's opposition and his answers, was burning
with eagerness to speak. He was constantly trying to break
in, but the legate enjoined silence, and at last was obliged to reprimand
him so sharply, that the master of the ceremonies left the
hall in confusion.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>"As to indulgences," said Luther, "if it can be shown that I
am mistaken, I am quite willing to be instructed. One may pass
over that point without being a bad Christian, but on the article
of faith, were I to yield a whit, I should be denying Jesus Christ.
With regard to it, then, I am neither able nor willing to yield, and
by the grace of God never shall."</p>

<p><i>De Vio, (beginning to lose temper.)</i>&mdash;"Whether you will or not,
you must this very day retract that article; otherwise for that
article alone, I will reject and condemn all your doctrine."</p>

<p><i>Luther.</i>&mdash;"I have no will apart from that of the Lord; He will
do with me what pleases him. But had I five heads, I would lose
them all sooner than retract the testimony which I have borne to
holy Christian faith."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span><i>De Vio.</i>&mdash;"I did not come here to reason with you. Retract,
or prepare to suffer the pains which you have deserved."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Luther saw plainly that it was impossible to settle the matter by
a conference. His opponent sat before him as if he were the pope
himself, and insisted on his receiving humbly, and with submission,
whatever he said, while his answers, even when founded on the
Holy Scriptures, were received with a shrug of his shoulders, and
all sorts of irony and contempt. He thought the wisest course
would be to answer the cardinal in writing. This method, thought
he, leaves at least some consolation to the oppressed. Others will
be able to form a judgment of the affair, and the unjust adversary,
who, by clamour, remains master of the field of battle, may be deterred
by it.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Luther having signified his intention to withdraw, the legate
said to him, "Do you wish me to give you a safe-conduct to
Rome?"</p>

<p>Nothing would have been more agreeable to Cajetan than the
acceptance of this offer, as it would have disencumbered him of a
task, the difficulties of which he began to comprehend. But the
Reformer, who saw all the difficulties with which he was surrounded
even at Augsburg, took good care not to accept a proposal
the effect of which could only have been to give him over, bound
hand and foot, to the vengeance of his enemies. He rejected it as
often as De Vio was pleased to renew it, and this was frequently.
The legate disguised the pain which he felt at Luther's refusal, and,
wrapping himself up in his dignity, dismissed the monk with a
smile of compassion, under which he tried to conceal his disappointment,
and at the same time the politeness of one who hopes he
may succeed better another time.</p>

<p>No sooner was Luther in the court of the palace than the talkative
Italian, the master of the ceremonies, whom his master's reprimands
had obliged to quit the hall of conference, delighted at being able
to speak out of sight of Cajetan, and burning with eagerness to
confound the abominable heretic by his luminous reasons, ran
after him, and continuing to walk, began to retail his sophisms.
But Luther, weary of this foolish personage, answered him with
one of those cutting expressions which he had so much at command,
and the poor master of the ceremonies left off, and returned
in confusion to the cardinal's palace.</p>

<p>Luther did not carry away a very high opinion of his opponent.
He had heard from him, as he afterwards wrote to Spalatin, propositions
which were quite at variance with theology, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
mouth of any other person would have been regarded as arch-heretical.
And yet De Vio was considered the most learned of the
Dominicans. Second to him was Prierias. "From this," says
Luther, "we may infer what those must have been who were tenth
or hundredth."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the noble and resolute bearing of the Wittemberg
doctor had greatly surprised the cardinal and his courtiers.
Instead of a poor monk humbly begging pardon, they had found
a free man, a decided Christian, an enlightened teacher, who insisted
that unjust accusations should be supported by proof, and
who defended his doctrine triumphantly. All the inmates of Cajetan's
palace inveighed against the pride, obstinacy, and effrontery
of this heretic. Luther and De Vio had mutually learned to know
each other, and both prepared for their second interview.</p>

<p>A very agreeable surprise awaited Luther on his return to the
convent of the Carmelites. The vicar-general of the Augustin
order, his friend, his father Staupitz, had arrived at Augsburg.
Not having been able to prevent Luther from coming to this city,
Staupitz gave his friend a new and touching proof of his attachment
by coming personally in the hope of being useful to him.
This excellent man foresaw that the conference with the legate
would lead to very serious consequences. He was equally agitated
by his fears and his friendship for Luther, who, after his painful
sederunt, felt it refreshing to clasp so valuable a friend in his arms.
Having told him that it had been impossible for him to get an
answer worth any thing, and how the legate had been contented
to demand a retractation without trying to convince him&mdash;"It is
absolutely necessary," said Staupitz, "to give the legate a written
answer."</p>

<p>After what he had heard of the first interview, Staupitz hoped
nothing from the others, and, therefore, determined on a proceeding
which he deemed necessary. He resolved to loose Luther from
obedience to his order. By this Staupitz hoped to gain two ends.
If, as all anticipated, Luther fell in the struggle, the disgrace of his
condemnation would not fall on the whole order; or if the cardinal
ordered Staupitz to oblige Luther to silence or retractation, he would
have an excuse for not doing it.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The ceremony, which took place
in the usual form, made Luther aware of all that he had thenceforth
to expect. He felt exceedingly at seeing the ties which he
had formed in the enthusiasm of his youth, thus broken. The order
of his choice rejects him. His natural protectors stand aloof, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
he becomes a stranger to his brethren. But though his heart is
filled with sadness at the thought, he recovers all his joy on turning
to the promises of a faithful God, who has said, "<i>I will never leave
you nor forsake you</i>."</p>

<p>The counsellors of the empire having intimated to the legate,
through the Bishop of Trent, that Luther was provided with an
imperial safe-conduct, and having caused it to be declared at the
same time, that nothing was to be attempted against the doctor's
person, De Vio became angry, and sharply replied in words characteristically
Roman, "Very well, but I will do what the pope
commands."<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> We know what this was.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Communication to the Legate&mdash;Second Appearance&mdash;Luther's Declaration&mdash;The
Legate's Reply&mdash;The Legate's Volubility&mdash;Luther's Request.</p></blockquote>


<p>The next day<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> both parties prepared for the second interview,
which promised to be decisive. The friends of Luther, who had
resolved to accompany him to the legate, repaired to the convent
of the Carmelites. The dean of Trent, and Peutinger, both counsellors
of the emperor, and Staupitz, arrived in succession. Shortly
after the doctor had the pleasure to see them joined by the Chevalier
Philip von Feilitsch, and Doctor Ruhel, counsellors of the Elector,
who had been ordered by their master to attend the conferences,
and protect the liberty of Luther. They had arrived the previous
evening, and were, says Mathesius, to stand at his side, as at
Constance the Chevalier de Chlum stood at the side of John Huss.
The doctor, moreover, took a notary, and accompanied with all these
friends, proceeded to the legate.</p>

<p>At this moment Staupitz came up to him; he thoroughly comprehended
Luther's situation, and knew that if he did not fix his
eye solely on the Lord, who is the deliverer of his people, he must
succumb. "My dear brother," said he to him seriously, "constantly
remember that you have begun these things in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ." Thus God surrounded his humble servant
with consolation and encouragement.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Luther, on arriving at the cardinal's, found a new opponent.
This was the prior of the Dominicans of Augsburg, who was seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
at the side of his chief. Luther, agreeably to the resolution which
he had formed, had written his reply, and, after the usual salutations,
with a firm voice read the following declaration:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I declare that I honour the holy Roman Church, and that I
will continue to honour it. I have sought the truth in public discussions;
and all that I have said I regard, even at this hour, as
just, true, and Christian. Still I am a man, and maybe mistaken.
I am, therefore, disposed to receive instruction and correction in
the things in which I may have erred. I declare myself ready to
reply, by word of mouth or by writing, to all the objections and
all the charges which my lord the legate may bring against me.
I declare myself ready to submit my theses to the four universities
of Bâsle, Friburg in Brisgau, Louvain, and Paris; and to retract
what they declare to be erroneous. In a word, I am ready to do
all that may be demanded of a Christian. But I protest solemnly
against the course which is sought to be given to this affair, and
against the strange pretension of constraining me to retract without
having refuted me."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, nothing could be more equitable than these proposals
of Luther, and yet they must have been very embarrassing
to a judge whose decision had been prescribed to him beforehand.
The legate, who had not expected this protestation, sought to
conceal his uneasiness by pretending to laugh at it, and assuming
an exterior of gentleness, said to Luther, smiling, "This protestation
is unnecessary, I will not dispute with you either in
public or in private, but I purpose to arrange the affair kindly,
and like a father." The whole policy of the cardinal consisted in
putting aside the strict forms of justice, which afford protection to
those who are prosecuted, and in treating the affair only as one of
administration between superior and inferior;&mdash;a commodious
method, in as much as it opens up a wide field for arbitrary procedure.</p>

<p>Still maintaining the most affectionate manner, "My dear
friend," said De Vio, "abandon, I pray you, a useless design.
Rather return to yourself, acknowledge the truth, and I am ready
to reconcile you with the Church and the sovereign bishop.
Whether you will or not, it matters little. It will be hard for you
to kick against the pricks...."</p>

<p>Luther, who saw himself treated as if he were already proved a
rebellious child, rejected of the Church, exclaimed, "I cannot retract;
but I offer to answer, and in writing. "We had enough of debating
yesterday."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
De Vio was irritated at this expression, which reminded him that
he had not acted with sufficient prudence; but he recovered himself,
and said with a smile, "Debating, my dear son! I did not debate
with you. I have no wish to debate; but in order to please the
most serene Elector Frederick, I am willing to hear you, and exhort
you amicably and paternally."</p>

<p>Luther did not comprehend why the legate should have been
so much offended at the expression which he had used; for, thought
he, if I had not wished to speak politely, I would have said,
not <i>debated</i>, but <i>disputed</i>, and <i>wrangled</i>,&mdash;for that was truly what
we did.</p>

<p>Still De Vio, who felt that before the respectable witnesses who
were present at the conference it was at least necessary to seem to
try to convince Luther to return to the two propositions, which he
had singled out as fundamental errors, thoroughly resolved to let
the Reformer speak as little as possible. Strong in his Italian
volubility he overwhelms him with objections, to which he does not
wait for a reply. Sometimes he jests, sometimes he scolds; he
declaims with impassioned heat, mixes up the most heterogeneous
subjects, quotes St. Thomas and Aristotle, cries, and gets into a
passion with all who differ with him in opinion, and then apostrophises
Luther. Luther, more than ten times, tries to speak, but the
legate instantly interrupts him, and showers down menaces upon
him. Retractation! retractation! is the whole sum of his demand;
he thunders, and domineers, and insists on having all the talk to
himself.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Staupitz interferes to stop the legate. "Have the
goodness," says he, "to give Doctor Martin time to answer." But
the legate recommences his discourse, quotes the <i>extravagants</i> and
the opinions of St. Thomas, determined to harangue during the
whole interview. If he cannot convince, and if he dares not strike,
he at least can stun.</p>

<p>Luther and Staupitz saw clearly that they must abandon the
hope, not only of enlightening De Vio by discussion, but also of
making a useful profession of faith. Luther, therefore, resumed
the request which he had made at the commencement, and which
the cardinal had then evaded. Since he was not permitted to
speak, he asked that he might, at least, be allowed to write, and
send his written reply to the legate. Staupitz supported him;
several others who were present joined their entreaties, and Cajetan,
notwithstanding of all his repugnance for what was written, (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
he remembered that what is written remains,) at last consented.
The meeting broke up. The hope of terminating the affair at this
interview was adjourned, and it became necessary to await the
result of a subsequent conference.</p>

<p>The permission which the general of the Dominicans gave Luther
to prepare an answer, and to answer in writing, the two distinct
and articulate accusations which he had made, touching
indulgences and faith, was nothing more than justice demanded,
and yet we are obliged to De Vio for it, as a mark of moderation
and impartiality.</p>

<p>Luther left the cardinal's palace delighted that his request had
been granted. In going and returning he was the object of public
attention. All enlightened men were interested in his case, as if it
had been their own, for it was felt that the cause then pleaded at
Augsburg was the cause of the gospel, justice, and liberty. The
lowest of the people alone were with Cajetan; and of this he
doubtless gave some significant hints to the Reformer, who afterwards
spoke of them.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>It became more and more evident that the legate had no wish to
hear any more from Luther than the words "I retract;" and these
Luther was resolved not to pronounce. What will be the issue
of this unequal struggle? How can it be imagined that the whole
power of Rome, brought to bear on a single man, will not succeed
in crushing him? Luther sees this. Feeling the weight of the terrible
hand under which he is placed, he gives up the hope of ever
returning to Wittemberg, revisiting his dear Philip, and again
finding himself in the midst of the generous youths into whose
hearts he loved so much to shed the seeds of life. He sees excommunication
hanging over his head, and has no doubt that it must
shortly fall upon him.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> These prospects afflict his soul, but do not
overwhelm it. His confidence in God is not shaken. God may
break the instrument which he has been pleased till now to employ,
but the truth will be maintained. Whatever happens, Luther must
defend it to the last. He accordingly, begins to prepare the protestation
which he is to present to the legate. It appears that he
devoted to it part of the 13th October.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Third Appearance&mdash;Treasury of Indulgences&mdash;Faith&mdash;Humble Request&mdash;Legate's
Reply&mdash;Luther's Reply&mdash;Legate's Rage&mdash;Luther Retires&mdash;First Defection.</p></blockquote>


<p>On Friday the 14th October, Luther returned to the cardinal,
accompanied by the counsellors of the Elector. The Italians pressed
around him as usual, and were present at the conference in great
numbers. Luther advanced, and presented his protestation to the
legate. The cardinal's people looked with astonishment at a writing
which, in their eyes, was so audacious. The following is the
doctor of Wittemberg's declaration to their master:<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You attack me on two points. First, you oppose to me the
Constitution of Pope Clement VI, in which it is said, that the
treasury of indulgences is the merit of Jesus Christ and the saints;
whereas I deny this in my theses.</p>

<p>"Panormitanus, (Luther thus designates Ives, author of the
famous collection of ecclesiastical law, entitled <i>Panormia</i>, and
Bishop of Chartres at the end of the eleventh century,) Panormitanus
declares, in his First Book, that in regard to holy faith, not
only a General Council, but every believer is superior to the pope,
if he produces declarations of Scripture, and better arguments than
the pope.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>"The voice of our Lord Jesus Christ rises far above all the voices
of men, whatever be the names they bear.</p>

<p>"What gives me the greatest pain and uneasiness is, that this
Constitution contains doctrines quite opposed to the truth. It declares
that the merits of the saints is a treasure, while all Scripture
testifies that God recompenses far more richly than we deserve.
The prophet exclaims, 'Lord, enter not into judgment with thy
servant; for in thy sight can no living man be justified.'<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> 'Woe
to men, however honourable and laudable their life may be,' says
St. Augustine, 'were judgment passed upon it without mercy.'<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>"Hence the saints are not saved by their merits, but only by the
mercy of God, as I have declared. I maintain this, and adhere
firmly to it. The words of holy Scripture, which declare that the
saints have not enough of merit, must take precedence of the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of men, who affirm that they have too much; for the pope is not
above, but beneath the word of God."</p>

<p>Luther does not stop here, but shows that if indulgences cannot
be the merit of saints, no more are they the merit of Christ. He
observes, that indulgences are barren and without fruit, since they
have no other effect than to exempt men from doing good works,
such as prayers and alms. "No," exclaims he, "the merit of
Christ is not a treasure of indulgences, which exempts from well-doing;
but a treasure of grace, which gives life. The merit of
Christ is applied to believers without indulgences, without keys,
by the Holy Spirit only, and not by the pope. If any one has a
better founded opinion than mine," adds he, in concluding this first
point, "let him show it, and then I will retract."</p>

<p>"I have affirmed," says he, in coming to the second article,
"that no man can be justified before God unless it be by faith, and
hence that it is necessary for man to believe with full assurance
that he has obtained grace. To doubt of this grace is to reject it.
The righteousness and life of the righteous is his faith."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Luther proves his proposition by a multitude of quotations from
Scripture.</p>

<p>"Be pleased, then, to intercede for me with our most holy lord,
Pope Leo X," adds he, "in order that he may not treat me with
so much disfavour.... My soul seeks the light of truth. I am
not so proud, so desirous of vain-glory, as to be ashamed to retract
if I have taught what is false. My greatest joy will be to see the
triumph of whatever accords with the will of God. Only let them
not force me to do anything which is contrary to the cry of my
conscience."</p>

<p>The legate had taken the declaration from Luther's hands, and
after having perused it, said to him coldly, "You have here useless
verbiage, you have written many vain words; you have answered
the two articles foolishly, and blotted your paper with a number of
passages of holy Scripture which have no reference to the subject."
Then, with a disdainful air, De Vio threw down the protestation,
as setting no value upon it, and resuming the tone which he had
found tolerably successful at the last interview, began to cry at
full pitch that Luther must retract. Luther was immovable.
"Friar! friar!" exclaims De Vio in Italian, "last time you were
very good, but to-day you are very naughty." Then the cardinal
begins a long discourse, drawn from the writings of St. Thomas,
again loudly extols the Constitution of Clement VI, and persists in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
maintaining, that, in virtue of this Constitution, the very merits of
Jesus Christ are distributed to the faithful by means of indulgences.
He thinks he has silenced Luther, who sometimes begins to speak,
but De Vio scolds, thunders away without ceasing, and insists on
having the whole field of battle to himself.</p>

<p>This method might have had some success a first time, but Luther
was not the man to suffer it a second. His indignation at
length burst forth; it is his turn to astonish the spectators, who
deem him already vanquished by the volubility of the prelate. He
raises his powerful voice, seizes the favourite objection of the cardinal,
and makes him pay dear for his temerity in having entered
the lists with him. "Retract! retract!" repeated De Vio, showing
the Constitution of the pope. "Well," replied Luther, "if it can
be proved by this Constitution that the treasure of indulgences is
the merit of Jesus Christ, I consent to retract according to the will
and good pleasure of your Eminence...."</p>

<p>The Italians, who expected nothing of the kind, stared at these
words, and could scarcely contain their joy at seeing the enemy at
length caught in the net. The cardinal was, as it were, out of
himself; he laughed outright, but with a laugh in which anger and
indignation mingled; darting forward, he lays hold of the volume
containing the famous Constitution, looks it out, pounces upon it,
and, quite proud of his victory, reads it aloud, with boiling and
heaving breast.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The Italians exult; the Elector's counsellors are
uneasy and embarrassed: Luther is waiting for his opponent. At
length, when the cardinal comes to the words, "The Lord Jesus
Christ has acquired this treasure by his sufferings,". Luther stops
him, "Most worthy father," says he, "be so good as consider and
carefully meditate this expression, '<i>has acquired</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Christ has
acquired a treasure by his merits; the merits, therefore, are not
the treasure; for, to speak philosophically, cause and effect are
different things. The merits of Christ have acquired authority to
the pope to grant such indulgences to the people, but what the
hand of the pope distributes is not the merits themselves. Thus,
then my conclusion is true, and the Constitution, which you invoke
with so much noise, bears testimony with me to the truth which I
proclaim."</p>

<p>De Vio still holds the book in his hand; his eyes are still riveted
on the fatal passage, but he has nothing to reply. Thus he is
taken in the net which he himself had laid, and Luther with strong
hand keeps him in, to the inexpressible astonishment of the Italian
courtiers around him. The legate would have evaded the difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
but could not. He had long abandoned the testimony of
Scripture and the authority of the Fathers; he had taken refuge in
this Extravagant of Clement VI, and there he is caught. Still he
has too much finesse to let his embarrassment appear. Wishing
to hide his shame, the prince of the Church suddenly changes the
subject, and rushes violently to other articles. Luther who perceives
the adroit man&oelig;uvre, allows him not to escape; he grasps
and completely closes the net which he has thrown over the cardinal,
and makes evasion impossible. "Most reverend father!"
says he, with an irony clothed in the form of respect, "your Eminence
cannot surely think that we Germans do not know grammar;
to be a treasure, and to acquire a treasure, are very different
things."</p>

<p>"Retract!" says De Vio; "retract, or, if you don't, I send you
to Rome, to appear there before the judges entrusted with the
cognisance of your cause. I excommunicate you; you, all your
partizans, all who are or may become favourable to you, and I reject
them from the Church. Full authority in this respect has
been given me by the holy apostolic See.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Think you your protectors
can stop me? Do you imagine that the pope cares for
Germany? The little finger of the pope is stronger than all the
German princes."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>"Deign," replies Luther, "to send the written reply which I
handed you to pope Leo X, with my very humble prayers."</p>

<p>At these words, the legate, glad to find a moment's respite, again
wraps himself up in a feeling of his dignity, and proudly and passionately
says to Luther:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Retract, or return not."<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>Luther is struck with the expression. This time he gives no
verbal answer, but bows and takes his leave, followed by the
Elector's counsellors. The cardinal and his Italians, left alone,
stare at each other, confounded at the issue of the debate.</p>

<p>Thus the Dominican system, clad in the Roman purple, had
proudly dismissed its humble opponent. But Luther felt that there
is a power, viz., Christian truth&mdash;truth, which no authority, secular
or spiritual, can ever subdue. Of the two combatants, he
who withdrew was master of the field.</p>

<p>This is the first step by which the Church detached herself from
the papacy.</p>

<p>Luther and De Vio never saw each other again; but the Reformer
had made a powerful impression on the legate, an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
which was never entirely effaced. What Luther had said
on faith, and what De Vio read in the subsequent writings of the
doctor of Wittemberg, greatly modified the cardinal's views. The
theologians of Rome were surprised and displeased at his statements
on justification in his Commentary on the Epistle to the
Romans. The Reformer did not recoil, did not retract; but
his judge, he who never ceased exclaiming, Retract! changed his
views, and indirectly retracted his errors. In this way was the
Reformer's unshaken fidelity rewarded.</p>

<p>Luther returned to the convent where he had met with hospitality.
He had stood firm, had borne testimony to the truth and
done his part. God will do the rest. His heart was filled with
peace and joy.</p>

<h2>CHAP. IX.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">De Vio and Staupitz&mdash;Staupitz and Luther&mdash;Luther and Spalatin&mdash;Luther to Carlstadt&mdash;Communion&mdash;Link
and De Vio&mdash;Departure of Staupitz and Link&mdash;Luther
to Cajetan&mdash;The Cardinal's Silence&mdash;Luther's Farewell&mdash;Departure&mdash;Appeal to
the Pope.</p></blockquote>


<p>Still the news brought to him were not at all satisfactory. The
rumour in the town was, that if he would not retract, he was to
be seized and immured in a dungeon. The vicar-general of the
order, Staupitz himself, it was confidently said, had been obliged
to consent to it.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Luther cannot believe what is told him of his
friend. No! Staupitz will not betray him. As to the designs of
the cardinal, judging by his own words, it is difficult to doubt.
Still he is unwilling to flee before the danger; his life, like truth
herself, is in mighty hands; and, notwithstanding of the danger
which threatens him, he resolves not to quit Augsburg.</p>

<p>The legate soon repented of his violence. He felt that he had
gone out of his course, and he was desirous to return to it.
Scarcely had Staupitz finished dinner, (it was the morning when
the interview had taken place, and the dinner-hour was mid-day,)
when he received a message from the cardinal to wait upon him.
Staupitz was accompanied by Winceslaus Link.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The vicar-general
found the legate alone with Serra-Longa. De Vio immediately
went up to Staupitz, and, in the mildest accents said to him:&mdash;"Try,
then, to persuade your monk, and induce him to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
retraction. Of a truth I am otherwise satisfied with him, and he
has not a better friend than I."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p><i>Staupitz.</i>&mdash;"I have done so already, and will still counsel him
to submit to the Church in all humility."</p>

<p><i>De Vio.</i>&mdash;"You must answer the arguments which he draws
from holy Scripture."</p>

<p><i>Staupitz.</i>&mdash;"I must confess to you, my lord, that that is beyond
my strength; for Dr. Martin is my superior both in talent and in
knowledge of the holy Scriptures."</p>

<p>The cardinal doubtless smiled at the vicar-general's frankness.
He himself knew, besides, wherein lay the difficulty of convincing
Luther. He continued, and said to Link:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you aware, that, as partizans of a heretical doctrine, you
are yourselves liable to the pains of the Church?"</p>

<p><i>Staupitz.</i>&mdash;Deign to resume the conference with Luther. Appoint
a public discussion of the controverted points."</p>

<p><i>De Vio</i>, (<i>terrified at the very idea.</i>)&mdash;"I won't have any further
discussion with that beast. For it has in its head piercing eyes
and strange speculations."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Staupitz at last obtained the cardinal's promise to give Luther a
written statement of what he was to retract.</p>

<p>The vicar-general went immediately to Luther, and, shaken by
the cardinal's representations, tried to bring about some arrangement.
"Refute then," says Luther, "the passages of Scripture
which I have brought forward." "It is above my power," said
Staupitz. "Well," said Luther, "it is against my conscience to
retract, so long as no other explanation can be given of these passages."
"What!" continued he, "the cardinal pretends, as you
assure me, that he is desirous to arrange the affair without shame
or disadvantage to me. Ah! these are Roman words, and signify
in good German that it would be my disgrace and eternal ruin.
What else has he to expect, who, from fear of man and against the
voice of his conscience, abjures the truth?"<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>Staupitz did not insist; he merely intimated that the cardinal
had consented to give him a written statement of the points of
which he demanded a retractation. Then, doubtless, he informed
him of his resolution to leave Augsburg, where he had nothing
more to do, and Luther imparted to him a design which he had
formed with a view to comfort and strengthen their souls.</p>

<p>Staupitz promised to return, and they separated for a short
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>Luther, left alone in his cell, turned his thoughts towards friends
who were dear to his heart. He transported himself to Weimar
and Wittemberg. He was desirous to inform the Elector of what
was passing; and, afraid of compromising the prince by addressing
him directly, wrote to Spalatin, and begged him to inform his
master how matters stood. He related the whole affair, even to
the promise of the legate to give him a written statement of the
controverted points, and concluded:&mdash;"Thus matters are; but I
have neither hope nor confidence in the legate. I will not retract
a single syllable. I will publish the reply which I have sent him,
in order that, if he proceeds to violence, his shame may extend
over all Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>The doctor next availed himself of some moments still left him
to communicate with his friends at Wittemberg.</p>

<p>"Peace and felicity!" wrote he to Doctor Carlstadt. "Accept
these few lines as if they were a long letter; for time and events
are pressing on me. Another time I will write you and others at
greater length. For three days my affair has been under discussion,
and things are now come to this, that I have no hope of
returning to you, and expect nothing but excommunication. The
legate is absolutely determined that I shall have no discussion,
either public or private. He says, he wishes not to be my judge
but my father, and yet the only words he will hear from me are,
'I retract, and own that I have been mistaken.' These, again, are
words which I won't say.</p>

<p>"My cause is in so much the greater peril, that its judges are
not only implacable enemies, but, moreover, men incapable of comprehending
it. However, the Lord God lives and reigns; to his
care I commend myself, and I doubt not that, in answer to the
prayers of some pious souls, he will send me assistance; methinks
I feel that I am prayed for.</p>

<p>"Either I shall return to you without having suffered harm, or,
struck with excommunication, will be obliged to seek an asylum
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Be this as it may, comport yourself valiantly, stand firm,
exalt Christ intrepidly and joyfully....</p>

<p>"The cardinal always calls me his dear son. I know what this
amounts to. Nevertheless, I am persuaded I would be to him the
dearest and most agreeable of men, if I would only pronounce the
single word <i>Revoco</i>, I retract. But I will not become a heretic by
retracting the faith which made me become a Christian. Better be
hunted, cursed, burnt, and put to death....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>"Take care of yourself, my dear doctor, and show this letter to
our theologians, to Amsdorff, Philip, Otten, and others, in order
that you may pray for me, and also for yourselves; for the affair
which is here discussed is yours also. It is that of faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ, and of divine grace."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>Delightful thought! which ever gives full peace and consolation
to those who have borne testimony to Jesus Christ, to his divinity
and grace, when the world from all quarters showers down its
censures, ejections, and frowns. "Our cause is that of faith in
our Lord!" And how sweet also the conviction expressed by the
Reformer, "I feel that I am prayed for." The Reformation was
the work of prayer and piety. The struggle between Luther and
De Vio was a struggle between the religious element re-appearing
in full life, and the expiring remains of the quibbling dialectics of
the middle ages.</p>

<p>Such was Luther's converse with his absent friends. Staupitz
soon returned; Doctor Ruhel and the Chevalier de Ferlitzoch, the
Elector's envoys, also arrived after they had taken leave of the
cardinal. Some other friends of the gospel joined them; and
Luther, seeing the generous men thus assembled on the point of
separating, perhaps separating from himself for ever, proposed
that they should join in celebrating the Lord's Supper. The
proposal was accepted, and this little flock of believers communicated
in the body and blood of Jesus Christ. What feelings
must have filled the hearts of these friends of the Reformer at this
moment when celebrating the Eucharist with him and thinking
that it was perhaps the last time he would be permitted to do so!
What joy and love must have animated Luther's heart at seeing
himself so graciously received by his Master at an hour when men
were repulsing him! How solemn must that supper have been&mdash;how
sacred that evening!<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The next day<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Luther waited for the articles which the legate
was to send him, but no message arriving, he begged his friend,
Dr. Winceslaus Link, to go to the cardinal. De Vio received
Link with the greatest affability, and assured him that he would
act only as a friend. "I no longer," says he, "regard Doctor
Martin Luther as a heretic. I will not excommunicate him at
this time, at least if I do not receive other orders from Rome. I
have sent his reply to the pope by an express." Then, to give a
proof of his good intentions, he added, "Would Doctor Martin
Luther only retract what relates to the indulgences, the affair would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
soon be ended; for, with regard to faith in the sacrament, it is an
article which every one may interpret and understand in his own
way." Spalatin, who relates these words, adds the sarcastic but
just remark: "It clearly follows, that Rome has more regard for
money than for the purity of the faith and the salvation of souls."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Link returned to Luther. He found Staupitz with him, and
gave an account of his visit. When he mentioned the legate's
unlooked for concession, "It had been worth while," said Staupitz,
"for Dr. Winceslaus to have had a notary and witnesses with
him to take down the words, for if such a proposal was known it
would greatly prejudice the cause of the Romans."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the smoother the prelate's words became, the less
the honest Germans trusted him. Several of the worthy men to
whom Luther had been recommended consulted together. "The
legate," said they, "is plotting some mischief by the courier of
whom he speaks; there is good ground to fear that you will all be
seized and cast into prison."</p>

<p>Staupitz and Winceslaus, therefore, determined to quit the
town. Embracing Luther, who persisted in remaining at Augsburg,
they set out in all haste by different roads for Nuremberg,
not without a feeling of great uneasiness as to the fate of the intrepid
witness whom they left behind.</p>

<p>Sunday passed quietly enough. Luther waited in vain for a
message from the legate. But as he did not send him a word,
Luther at last resolved to write him. Staupitz and Link, before
their departure, had begged him to make all possible submission
to the cardinal. Luther was yet without experience in Rome and
its envoys; but if submission did not succeed, he would be able to
regard it as a warning. Now, he must at least make the attempt.
In so far as concerns himself, not a day passes in which
he does not condemn himself, does not mourn over the facility
with which he allows himself to be hurried into expressions which
exceed the bounds of propriety. Why should he not confess
to the cardinal that which he daily confesses to God? Luther,
moreover, had a heart which was easily touched, and which
suspected no evil. He therefore took up the pen, and, under a
feeling of respect and good will, wrote to the cardinal as follows:<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Most worthy Father in God</span>,&mdash;I come once more, not
with my voice, but by writing, to supplicate your paternal goodness
to give me a favourable hearing. The reverend Doctor Staupitz,
my very dear Father in Christ, has asked me to humble myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to renounce my own opinion, and submit it to the judgment
of pious and impartial men. He also has lauded your paternal
goodness, and convinced me of the favourable sentiments with
which you are animated towards me. The tidings filled me with
joy.</p>

<p>"Now, then, most worthy father, I confess, as I have already
done, that I have not shown enough of modesty, enough of meekness,
enough of respect for the name of the sovereign pontiff; and
although I have been greatly provoked, I perceive it would have
been far better for me to have treated the affair with more humility,
good nature, and reverence, '<i>not answering a fool according to his
folly, for fear of being like unto him</i>.' (Prov., xxvi, 4.)</p>

<p>"This grieves me very much; I ask pardon for it; and I am
willing to announce it to the people from the pulpit, as indeed I
have already often done. I will endeavour, by the grace of God,
to speak differently. Moreover, I am ready to promise, that, unless
I am asked, I will not say a single word on the subject of indulgences
after this affair is arranged. But, in like manner, let those
who led me to begin it be obliged hereafter to be moderate in their
discourses, or to be silent.</p>

<p>"As regards the truth of my doctrine, the authority of St.
Thomas and other doctors cannot satisfy me. If I am worthy of
it, I must hear the voice of the spouse, who is the Church. For
it is certain that she hears the voice of the Bridegroom who is
Christ.</p>

<p>"With all humility and submission, therefore, I pray your paternal
love to refer the whole of this matter, which to this hour is
so uncertain, to our most holy lord, Leo X, in order that the
Church may decide, pronounce, and ordain, thereby enabling men
to retract with a good conscience, or to believe in sincerity."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>The reading of this letter suggests a reflection. It shows us that
Luther was not acting on a premeditated system, but only in virtue
of convictions which were successively impressed on his mind and
his heart.</p>

<p>So far from having adopted a fixed system, or calculated opposition,
he was sometimes, without suspecting it, at variance with
himself. Old convictions still prevailed in his mind, even after
contrary convictions had taken root. And yet, in these evidences
of sincerity and truth, men have searched for weapons to assail the
Reformation; because it followed the obligatory law of progress
invariably imposed on the human mind, they have written the
history of its variations; in the very traits which attest its sincerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and consequently do it honour, one of the greatest geniuses of
Christendom has found his strongest objections to it.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Inconceivable
is the waywardness of the human mind!</p>

<p>Luther received no answer to his letter. Cajetan and his courtiers,
from being violently agitated, became all at once motionless.
What could the reason be? Might it not be the calm which
precedes the storm? Some are of the opinion of Pallavicini, who
observes, that "the cardinal expected that the proud monk would,
like inflated bellows, gradually lose the wind with which he was
filled, and become quite humble."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Others, who thought themselves
better acquainted with the ways of Rome, felt assured that
the legate was preparing to seize Luther; but not daring, of his
own accord, to proceed to such extremities in defiance of the imperial
safe-conduct, was waiting for an answer from Rome. Others,
again, could not admit that the cardinal would consent to wait so
long. The Emperor, Maximilian, they said, (and this may indeed
have been true,) would have no more scruple in delivering up
Luther to the judgment of the Church, in spite of the safe-conduct,
than Sigismund had in delivering up John Huss to the Council of
Constance. Their conjecture, therefore, was, that the legate was
negotiating with the emperor. The sanction of Maximilian might
arrive at any hour. The greater the opposition he had formerly
showed to the pope, the more disposed he now seemed to flatter
him, until he should succeed in encircling the head of his grandson
with the imperial crown. There was not an instant to be lost,
"and, therefore," said the generous men around Luther, "prepare
an appeal to the pope, and quit Augsburg without delay."</p>

<p>Luther, whose presence in the town had for four days been
quite useless, and who, by remaining these four days after the
departure of the Saxon counsellors whom the Elector had sent to
watch over his safety, had sufficiently demonstrated that he feared
nothing, and was ready to answer every charge, at length yielded
to the urgent entreaties of his friends. Wishing to leave a notification
to De Vio, he wrote him on Tuesday, the evening before
his departure. This second letter is firmer in its tone than the
former. It would seem that Luther, in perceiving that all his advances
were vain, began to hold up his head, and show that he had
a due sense both of his own rights, and of the injustice of his
enemies.</p>

<p>"Most worthy Father in God," wrote he to De Vio, "your paternal
goodness has seen, yes, I say, seen, and distinctly recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
my obedience. I have undertaken a distant journey, in the
midst of great dangers, in much bodily weakness, and notwithstanding
of my extreme poverty, on the order of our most holy
lord, Leo X. I have appeared personally before your Eminence;
in fine, I have thrown myself at the feet of his Holiness, and
am now waiting his pleasure, prepared to acquiesce in his judgment,
whether he condemn or acquit me. I thus feel that I have
omitted nothing which becomes an obedient son of the Church.</p>

<p>"Hence, I cannot see it to be my duty uselessly to prolong my
sojourn here; indeed, it is impossible for me to do so. I want
means, and your paternal goodness has commanded me, in peremptory
terms, not again to show myself in your presence, unless I
am willing to retract.</p>

<p>"I depart, therefore, in the name of the Lord, desiring, if it be
possible, to repair to some spot where I may be able to live in
peace. Several personages, of greater weight than I am, have
urged me to appeal from your paternal goodness, and even from
our most holy lord, Leo X, ill informed, to himself better informed.
Although I know that such an appeal will be much
more agreeable to our most serene Elector than a retractation,
nevertheless, if I had only had myself to consult, I would not have
taken it. Having committed no fault, I ought to have nothing to
fear."</p>

<p>Luther, having written this letter, which was not sent to the
legate till after his departure, prepared to quit Augsburg. God
had kept him till this hour, and his heart praised Him for it; but
he must not tempt God. He took leave of his friends, Peutinger,
Langemantel, the Adelmanns, Auerbach, and the prior of the Carmelites,
who had shown him so much Christian hospitality. On
Wednesday before day-break he got up, and was ready to depart.
His friends had advised him to use great precaution, lest his intention
should be observed and frustrated, and he followed their
counsels as much as he could. A pony, which Staupitz had left
him, was brought to the gate of the convent, and once more bidding
adieu to his brethren, he mounted and set off, without bridle,
boots, or spurs, and unarmed. The magistrates had sent one of
their officers on horseback, who was to accompany him, and who
knew the roads perfectly. The servant led him in the darkness,
through the silent streets of Augsburg, towards a small gate which
was pierced in the city wall, and which counsellor Langemantel
had given orders should be opened to him. He is still in the
power of the legate, and the hand of Rome may still reach him.
Doubtless, did the Italians know that their prey was escaping, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
would sally forth in fury with hue and cry. Who knows if the
intrepid opponent of Rome will not yet be seized and immured in
a dungeon?... At length Luther and his guide arrive at the
little gate, and, passing through it, are out of Augsburg. Then,
putting their horses to the gallop, they make off in all haste.</p>

<p>Luther, on departing, had left his appeal to the pope in the
hands of the prior of Pomesaw. His friends were of opinion that
it should not be sent to the legate, and the prior was therefore
charged to see to its being fixed up, two or three days after the
doctor's departure, on the gate of the cathedral, in presence of a
notary and witnesses. This was accordingly done.</p>

<p>In this document, Luther declares that he appeals from the most
holy father the pope, ill informed, to the most holy lord and father
in Christ, by name Leo X, by the grace of God, when better informed.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
This appeal had been regularly drawn up and executed
in due form by Gall de Herbrachtingen, the imperial notary, in
presence of two Augustin monks, Bartholomew Utzmair and
Wengel Steinbies. It was dated 16th October.</p>

<p>When the cardinal was informed of Luther's departure, he was
astonished, and even, as he declares in a letter to the Elector, was
frightened and amazed. In fact, he had grounds for irritation.
This departure, which put so abrupt a termination to negotiation,
disappointed the hopes which had so long flattered him. His ambition
was to cure the wounds of the Church, and re-establish the
pope's influence in Germany; and, lo! the heretic has escaped not
only without having been punished, but even without having been
humbled. The conference had only served to bring more prominently
into view, on the one hand, the simplicity, uprightness, and
firmness of Luther; and, on the other, the imperiousness and unreasonable
conduct of the pope and his ambassador. Rome, having
gained nothing, must have lost: her authority not having been
strengthened, had, of necessity, experienced a new check. What
will be said at the Vatican? What tidings will arrive at Rome?
The difficulties of his situation will be forgotten, and the failure imputed
to his want of skill. Serra-Longa and the Italians are furious
at seeing persons of their ability outwitted by a German monk.
De Vio is scarcely able to conceal his irritation. The affront cries
for vengeance, and we shall soon see him giving vent to his wrath
in a letter to the Elector.</p>

<h2>CHAP. X.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Luther's Flight&mdash;Admiration&mdash;Luther's Wish&mdash;The Legate to the Elector&mdash;The
Elector to the Legate&mdash;Prosperity of the University.</p></blockquote>


<p>Luther continued with his guide to flee from Augsburg. He
urged his steed to the utmost speed that the poor animal's strength
would permit. He thought of the real or supposed flight of John
Huss, the manner in which he was laid hold of, and the assertion
of his adversaries, who pretended that the flight annulled the Emperor's
safe-conduct, and entitled them to condemn him to the
flames.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> These uneasy thoughts merely crossed Luther's mind.
Escaped from the town, where he had passed ten days under the
terrible hand of Rome, which had already crushed so many thousand
witnesses of the truth, and drenched herself with blood&mdash;now
that he is free, now that he breathes the pure air of the
field, and traverses the villages and plains&mdash;now that he sees
himself wonderfully delivered&mdash;his whole soul magnifies the Lord.
Truly he may now say, "<i>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our
help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
Luther's heart is thus filled with joy. But his thoughts also revert
to De Vio. "The cardinal," says he, "would have liked to have
me in his hands to send me to Rome. No doubt he is chagrined
at my escape. He imagined that he was master of me at Augsburg&mdash;he
thought he was sure of me; but he had an eel by the
tail. Is it not a shame in these people to set so high a price upon
me? They would give many crowns to have me; whereas, our
Lord Jesus Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>The first day Luther travelled fourteen leagues. In the evening,
on arriving at the inn where he was to pass the night, he was so
fatigued (his horse, says one of his biographers, had a very hard
trot,) that, on dismounting, he could not stand erect, and stretched
himself out upon the straw. He, nevertheless, enjoyed some sleep,
and the next day continued his journey. At Nuremberg, he found
Staupitz on a visit to the convents of his order, and, for the first
time saw the brief which the pope had sent to Cajetan respecting
him. He was indignant at it. In all probability, if he had read
it before his departure from Wittemberg, he would never have appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
before the cardinal. "It is impossible to believe," says he,
"that any thing so monstrous could emanate from a sovereign
pontiff."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the journey, Luther was an object of general interest.
He had not yielded a whit. Such a victory gained by a
mendicant monk over a representative of Rome, excited universal
admiration. Germany seemed avenged for the contempt of Italy.
The eternal Word had been more honoured than the word of the
pope; and that vast power which had domineered over the world
for so many ages had received an important check. Luther's
journey was a triumph. People were delighted with the obstinacy
of Rome, hoping that it would hasten her downfall. Had she not
chosen to keep fast hold of dishonest gains&mdash;had she been wise
enough not to despise the Germans&mdash;had she reformed clamant
abuses&mdash;perhaps, according to human views, things might have
returned to the state of death out of which Luther had aroused
them. But the papacy chooses not to yield, and the doctor will
see himself constrained to bring many other errors to light, and to
advance in the knowledge and the manifestation of the truth.</p>

<p>On the 26th October Luther arrived at Græfenthal, situated at
the extremity of the forests of Thuringia. Here he fell in with
Count Albert of Mansfeld, who had so strongly dissuaded him
from going to Augsburg. The count laughed heartily on seeing
his singular equipage; and, laying hands on him, obliged him to
become his guest. Shortly after Luther resumed his journey.</p>

<p>He made haste to be at Wittemberg by the 31st October, expecting
that the Elector would be there at the Feast of All Saints,
and that he would be able to see him. The brief which he had
read at Nuremberg had made him fully aware of the danger of his
situation. In fact, being already condemned at Rome, he could
not hope either to remain at Wittemberg, or to obtain an asylum
in a convent, or to be in peace and safety any where else. The
protection of the Elector might, perhaps, defend him, but he was
far from being able to calculate upon it. He could not expect any
help from the two friends whom he had formerly had at the court.
Staupitz, having lost the favour he long enjoyed, had quitted Saxony,
Spalatin was loved by Frederick, but had no great influence over
him. The Elector himself was not so well acquainted with the
gospel as to encounter manifest perils on account of it. However,
Luther saw nothing better which he could do than return to
Wittemberg, and there await the decision of an almighty and
merciful God. If, as several thought, he were left at liberty, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
wish was to devote himself entirely to study and the education of
youth.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>Luther did arrive at Wittemberg by the 30th October; but his
haste had been to no purpose, for neither the Elector nor Spalatin
came to the festival. His friends were overjoyed on seeing him
again among them. The very day of his arrival he hastened to
announce it to Spalatin&mdash;"I came back to Wittemberg to-day,
safe and sound, by the grace of God; but how long I shall remain
is more than I know.... I am filled with joy and peace; so much
so, that I cannot help wondering how the trial which I endure appears
so great to so many great personages."</p>

<p>De Vio did not wait long, after Luther's departure, to vent all
his indignation to the Elector. His letter breathes vengeance.
In an assuming tone he gives Frederick an account of the conference.
"Since friar Martin," says he, in conclusion, "cannot be
brought by paternal methods to acknowledge his error, and remain
faithful to the Catholic Church, I pray your Highness to send him
to Rome, or banish him from your States. Be assured that this
difficult, naughty, and venomous affair, cannot last longer; for,
when I shall have acquainted our most holy lord with all the craft
and malice, there will soon be an end of it." In a postscript, in
his own hand, the cardinal entreats the Elector not to sully his own
honour, and that of his illustrious ancestors, for a miserable paltry
friar.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Never, perhaps, was the soul of Luther filled with nobler indignation
than on reading the copy of this letter which the Elector sent
him. The thought of the sufferings which he is destined to endure,
the value of the truth for which he is combating, the contempt he
feels for the conduct of the legate of Rome, at once fill his heart.
His reply, written under the influence of those feelings, is full of
the courage, dignity, and faith, which he always manifested in the
most difficult crisis of his life. He, in his turn, gives an account
of the conference of Augsburg, and then, after exposing the conduct
of the cardinal continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to answer the legate in the Elector's stead.</p>

<p>"Prove that you speak with knowledge," I would say to him;
"let the whole affair be committed to writing; then I will send
Friar Martin to Rome, or rather, I myself will cause him to be
seized and put to death. I will take care of my conscience and my
honour, and allow no stain to sully my fame. But as long as your
certain knowledge shuns the light, and manifests itself only by
clamour, I cannot give credit to darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>"This, most excellent prince, would be my answer.</p>

<p>"Let the reverend legate, or the pope himself, give a written
specification of my errors; let them explain their reasons; let them
instruct me who desire, who ask, and wish, and wait for instruction,
in so much that even a Turk would not refuse to give it. If I
retract not, and condemn myself after they shall have proved to me
that the passages which I have cited ought to be understood differently
from what I have done, then, O most excellent Elector, let
your Highness be the first to pursue and chase me, let the university
discard me, and load me with its anger. Nay, more, (and I
call heaven and earth to witness,) let the Lord Jesus Christ reject
and condemn me! The words which I speak are not dictated by
vain presumption, but by immovable conviction. I am willing
that the Lord God withdraw his grace from me, and that every
creature of God refuse to countenance me, if, when a better doctrine
shall have been shown to me, I embrace it not.</p>

<p>"If, on account of the humbleness of my condition, they despise
me, a poor paltry mendicant friar, and if they refuse to instruct
me in the way of truth, let your Highness pray the legate to point
out to you in writing wherein I have erred; and, if they refuse this
favour even to your Highness, let them write their views either to
his Imperial Majesty, or to some Archbishop of Germany. What
ought I, what can I say more?</p>

<p>"Let your Highness listen to the voice of your honour and your
conscience, and not send me to Rome. No man can command you
to do it, for it is impossible I can be in safety at Rome. The pope
himself is not in safety there. It would be to order you to betray
Christian blood. They have paper, pens, and ink, and they have
also notaries without number. It is easy for them to write, and
show wherein and how I have erred. It will cost less to instruct
me by writing while I am absent, than while present to accomplish
my death by stratagem.</p>

<p>"I resign myself to exile. My enemies are so ensnaring me
on all sides, that I can no where live in safety. In order that no
evil may befall you on my account, I, in the name of God, abandon
your territories; I will go wherever an almighty and merciful God
wishes me to be. Let him do with me as seemeth to him good!</p>

<p>"Thus, then, most serene Elector, with veneration I bid you
farewell. I commend you to Almighty God, and give you immortal
thanks for all your kindness towards me. Whatever the people
among whom I shall live in future, I will always remember you,
and gratefully pray, without ceasing, for the happiness of you and
yours.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>... I am still, thank God, full of joy, and I bless him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that Christ his Son counts me worthy of suffering in so holy
a cause. May he eternally guard your illustrious Highness!
Amen!"</p>

<p>This letter, so replete with truth, made a profound impression on
the Elector. "He was shaken by a very eloquent letter," says
Maimbourg. He never would have thought of delivering an innocent
man into the hands of Rome. Perhaps he would have asked
Luther to remain for some time in concealment, but not even in
appearance would he have yielded, in any way, to the menaces of
the legate. He wrote to his counsellor Pfeffinger, who happened
to be with the Emperor, to make him acquainted with the real
state of matters, and beg him to request Rome either to put an
end to the affair, or at least leave it to be decided in Germany by
impartial judges.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>Some days after the Elector replied to the legate:&mdash;"Since
Doctor Martin appeared before you at Augsburg, you ought to be
satisfied. We did not expect that without having convicted him
you would have thought of constraining him to retract. None of
the learned in our dominions have told us that the doctrine of
Martin is impious, antichristian, and heretical." The prince then
refuses to send Luther to Rome, or banish him from his states.</p>

<p>This letter, which was communicated to Luther, filled him with
joy. "Good God!" wrote he to Spalatin, "with what joy I have
read it and re-read it. I know what confidence may be put in these
words, so admirable at once for vigour and moderation. I fear the
Romans will not comprehend all that is meant by them, but they
will at least comprehend that what they thought already finished
is not even begun. Have the goodness to present my thanks to
the prince. It is strange that he, (De Vio,) who not long ago was
a mendicant monk like me, is not afraid to accost the most powerful
princes without respect, to interpel, threaten, and command them,
and treat them with inconceivable pride. Let him learn that the
temporal power is of God, and that it is not permitted him to
trample its glory under foot."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Frederick, in answering the legate in a tone which he had not
expected, had doubtless been encouraged by an address which he
had received from the university of Wittemberg. This university
had good reason for declaring in the doctor's favour, in as much as
it was flourishing more and more, and eclipsing all the other schools.
Crowds of students flocked from all parts of Germany to hear the
extraordinary man whose lessons seemed to open a new era to religion
and science. These youths who came from all the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
stopped at the moment when they perceived the steeples of Wittemberg
in the distance, and raising their hands to heaven, thanked
God for making the light of truth shine on this town as formerly on
Zion, and send its rays even to the remotest countries.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> A life and
activity hitherto unknown animated the university. "They ply
their studies here like ants," wrote Luther.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<h2>CHAP. XI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Thoughts of Departure&mdash;Adieus to the Church&mdash;Critical Moment&mdash;Deliverance&mdash;Luther's
Courage&mdash;Discontentment at Rome&mdash;Bull&mdash;Appeal to a Council.</p></blockquote>


<p>Luther, thinking that he might soon be banished from Germany,
employed himself in preparing the Acts of the Conference of Augsburg
for publication. He wished these Acts to remain as evidence
of the struggle which he had maintained with Rome. He saw the
storm ready to burst, but feared it not. Day after day he expected
the anathemas of Rome, and arranged and set every thing in order,
that he might be ready when they arrived. "Having tucked up
my coat, and girt my reins," said he, "I am ready to depart like
Abraham; not knowing whither I shall go, or rather knowing well,
since God is every where."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> He intended to leave a farewell letter
behind him. "Have the boldness, then," wrote he to Spalatin,
"to read the letter of a man cursed and excommunicated."</p>

<p>His friends were in great fear and anxiety on his account, and
begged him to enter himself prisoner in the hands of the Elector,
in order that that prince might somewhere keep him in safe custody.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>His enemies could not understand what it was that gave him so
much confidence. One day they were talking of him at the court
of the Bishop of Brandenburg, and asking on what prop he could be
leaning. "It must be in Erasmus," said they, "or Capito, or some
other of the learned, that he confides." "No! no!" replied the
bishop, "the pope would give himself very little trouble with such
folks as these. His trust is in the university of Wittemberg and
the Duke of Saxony." Thus both were ignorant of the fortress in
which the Reformer had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Thoughts of departure flitted across Luther's mind. They arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
not from fear, but from the foresight of continually recurring
obstacles which the free profession of the truth must encounter in
Germany. "If I remain here," said he, "the liberty of speaking
and writing will, as to many things, be wrested from me. If I
depart, I will freely unbosom the thoughts of my heart, and offer
my life to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>France was the country in which Luther hoped he would be
able, untramelled, to announce the truth. The liberty which the
doctors and university of Paris enjoyed seemed to him worthy of
envy. He was, besides, agreed with them on many points. What
would have happened had he been transported from Wittemberg to
France? Would the Reformation have taken place there as it did
in Germany? Would the power of Rome have been dethroned;
and would France, which was destined to see the hierarchical principles
of Rome, and the destructive principles of an infidel philosophy,
long warring in its bosom, have become one great focus of
gospel light? It is useless to indulge in vain conjectures on this
subject; but perhaps Luther at Paris might have somewhat changed
the destinies of Europe and France.</p>

<p>Luther's soul was powerfully agitated. As he often preached at
the town church in place of Simon Heyens Pontanus, pastor of
Wittemberg, who was almost always sick, he thought it his duty,
at all events, to take leave of a people to whom he had so often
preached salvation. "I am," said he one day in the pulpit, "I
am a precarious and uncertain preacher. How often already have
I set out suddenly without bidding you farewell.... In case the
same thing should happen again, and I not return, here receive my
adieus." After adding a few words more, he thus meekly and
modestly ended:&mdash;"I warn you, in fine, not to be alarmed
though the papal censures let loose all their fury on me. Impute
it not to the pope, and wish no ill either to him or any other mortal
whatsoever, but commit the whole matter to God."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>The moment seemed to have at length arrived. The prince gave
Luther to understand he was desirous of his removal to a distance
from Wittemberg; and the wishes of the Elector were too sacred
for him not to hasten to comply with them. He accordingly made
preparations for his departure, without well knowing whither he
should direct his steps. He wished, however, to have a last meeting
with his friends, and for this purpose invited them to a farewell
repast. Seated at table with them, he was still enjoying their
delightful conversation, their tender and anxious friendship. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
letter is brought to him.... It comes from the court. He
opens and reads, and his heart sinks; it is a new order to depart.
The prince asks why he is so long of setting out. His soul was
filled with sadness. Still, however, he took courage, and raising
his head and looking around on his guests, said firmly and joyfully,
"Father and mother forsake me, but the Lord will take me up."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
There was nothing for it but to depart. His friends were deeply
moved. What is to become of him? If Luther's protector rejects
him, who will receive him? And the gospel, and the truth, and this
admirable work ... ; all doubtless must fall with their illustrious
witness. The Reformation apparently is hanging by a
thread; and at the moment when Luther quits the walls of Wittemberg,
will not the thread break? Luther and his friends spoke
little. Stunned with the blow which was directed against their
brother, they melt into tears. But some moments after a second
message arrives, and Luther opens the letter, not doubting he is
to find a renewal of the summons to depart. But, O powerful
hand of the Lord! for this time he is saved. The whole aspect is
changed. "As the new envoy of the pope hopes that every thing
may be arranged by means of a conference, remain still."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> So
says the letter. How important an hour this was; and who can
say what might have happened if Luther, who was always in haste
to obey the will of his prince, had quitted Wittemberg immediately
after the first message? Never were Luther and the work of the
Reformation at a lower ebb than at this moment. Their destinies
seemed to be decided; but an instant sufficed to change them.
Arrived at the lowest point in his career, the doctor of Wittemberg
rapidly reascended; and thenceforward his influence ceased
not to increase. In the language of a prophet, "The Eternal
commands, and his servants descend into the depths; again they
mount up to heaven."</p>

<p>Spalatin having, by order of Frederick, invited Luther to Lichtenberg
to have an interview with him, they had a long conversation
on the situation of affairs. "If the censures of Rome arrive,"
said Luther, "I certainly will not remain at Wittemberg." "Beware,"
"of being too precipitate with your journey to France,"
replied Spalatin,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> who, left telling him to wait till he heard
from him. "Only recommend my soul to Christ," said Luther to
his friends. "I see that my adversaries are strong in their resolution
to destroy me, but at the same time Christ strengthens me in
my resolution not to yield to them."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Luther at this time published the "<i>Acts of the Conference at
Augsburg</i>." Spalatin, on the part of the Elector, had written
him not to do it; but it was too late. After the publication
had taken place the prince approved of it; "Great God!" said
Luther in the preface, "what new, what astonishing crime, to
seek light and truth! And more especially to seek them in the
Church, in other words, in the kingdom of truth." In a letter to
Link he says, "I send you my <i>Acts</i>. They are more cutting,
doubtless, than the legate expected; but my pen is ready to give
birth to far greater things. I know not myself whence those
thoughts come. In my opinion the affair is not even commenced;<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
so far are the grandees of Rome from being entitled to hope it is
ended. I will send you what I have written, in order that you
may see whether I have divined well in thinking that the Antichrist
of which the Apostle Paul speaks is now reigning in the
court of Rome. I believe I am able to demonstrate that it is at
this day worse than the very Turks."</p>

<p>Ominous rumours reached Luther from all quarters. One of
his friends wrote to him, that the new envoy of Rome had received
orders to seize him, and deliver him up to the pope.
Another told him, that in travelling he had fallen in with a courtier,
and the conversation having turned on the affairs of Germany,
the courtier declared that he had come under an obligation to deliver
Luther into the hands of the sovereign pontiff. "But," wrote
the Reformer, "the more their fury and violence increase, the less
I tremble."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>At Rome there was great dissatisfaction with Cajetan. The
chagrin which they felt at the failure of the affair at first turned
upon him. The Roman courtiers thought themselves entitled to
reproach him with a want of that prudence and finesse which, if
they are to be believed, constitute the first quality of a legate, and
with having failed on so important an occasion, to give pliancy
to his scholastic theology. He is wholly to blame, said they. His
lumbering pedantry has spoiled all. Of what use was it to irritate
Luther by insults and menaces, instead of gaining him over by the
promise of a good bishopric, or even of a Cardinal's hat.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> These
hirelings judged the Reformer by themselves. However, it was
necessary to repair this blunder. On the one hand, Rome must
give her decision, and, on the other, due court must be paid to the
Elector, who might be of great use in the election of an emperor,
an event which must shortly take place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
As it was impossible for Roman ecclesiastics to suspect what
constituted the strength and courage of Luther, they imagined
that the Elector was much more implicated in the affair than he
really was. The pope, therefore, resolved to follow another line
of conduct. He caused his legate in Germany to publish a bull,
confirming the doctrine of indulgences in the very points in which
they were attacked, but without mentioning either the Elector or
Luther. As the Reformer had always expressed his readiness to
submit to the decision of the Roman Church, the pope thought that
he must now either keep his word, or stand openly convicted as a
disturber of the peace of the Church, and a contemner of the holy
Apostolic See. In either case it seemed that the pope must gain.
But nothing is gained by obstinately opposing the truth. In vain
had the pope threatened to excommunicate every man who should
teach otherwise than he ordered; the light was not arrested by
such orders. The wise plan would have been to curb the pretensions
of the venders of indulgences. This decree of Rome was
therefore a new blunder. By legalising clamant errors, it irritated
all the wise, and made it impossible for Luther to return. "It was
thought," says a Roman Catholic historian, a great enemy of the
Reformation,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> "that this bull had been made solely for the interest
of the pope and the mendicants, who began to find that nobody
would give anything for their indulgences."</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Vio published the bull at Lintz, in Austria, on
the 13th December, 1518, but Luther had already placed himself
beyond its reach. On the 28th November, in the chapel of Corpus
Christi at Wittemberg, he had appealed from the pope to a general
council of the Church. He foresaw the storm which was gathering
around him, and he knew that God alone could avert it. Still he
did as duty called him. He must, no doubt, quit Wittemberg
(were it only for the sake of the Elector) as soon as the Roman
anathema should arrive; but he was unwilling to quit Saxony and
Germany without a strong protestation. This he accordingly drew
up; and, in order that it might be ready for circulation the moment
the furies of Rome, as he expresses it, should reach him, he caused
it to be printed, under the express condition that the bookseller
Should deposit all the copies in his custody. But the bookseller, in
his eagerness for gain, sold almost the whole, while Luther was
quietly waiting to receive them. He felt annoyed, but the thing
was done. This bold protestation spread every where. In it
Luther declared anew that he had no intention to say any thing
against the Holy Church, or the authority of the Apostolic See, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the pope well advised. "But," continues he, "considering that the
pope, who is the vicar of God upon earth, may, like any other vicar,
err, sin, or lie, and that the appeal to a general council is the only
safeguard against unjust proceedings which it is impossible to resist,
I feel myself obliged to have recourse to it."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we see the Reformation launched on a new course.
It is no longer made to depend on the pope and his decisions, but
on an universal council. Luther addresses the whole Church, and
the voice which proceeds from the chapel of Corpus Christi, must
reach the whole members of Christ's flock. There is no want of
courage in the Reformer, and here he gives a new proof of it. Will
God fail him? The answer will be found in the different phases of
the Reformation which are still to be exhibited to our view.</p>

magis ejus <i>errorem</i> denotabis, qui hæreticorum causam contra Christianos et contra
<i>Ecclesiam Dei</i> asserere conatur ... qui unitatem et veritatem de divina lege venientem
non tenens.... Consuetudo sine veritate vetustas erroris est." (Epist. 74.)
"You will more and more observe the error of him who is trying to maintain the cause
of heretics against Christians and against the Church of God ... who not holding
the unity and truth which come by the Divine law.... Custom without truth
is the antiquity of error."... Firmilian, Bishop of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia, also
says after the middle of the third century: "Eos autem qui Romæ sunt, non ea in
omnibus observare quæ sunt ab origine tradita, et frustra auctoritatem apostolorum
prætendere.... Cæterum nos veritati et consuetudinem jungimus, et consuetudini
Romanorum, consuetudinem sed veritatis opponimus; ab initio hoc tenentes
quod a Christo et ab apostolo traditum est." (Cypr. Ep. 75.) "But they do not in all
things observe what was originally delivered, and in vain pretend the authority of
the apostles.... But we (the Bishops of the Churches of Asia, more ancient than
those of Rome) to truth join custom also, and to the custom of the Romans oppose
custom, but the custom of truth, holding from the beginning what was delivered by
Christ and an apostle." These testimonies are of great weight.</p></div>

<div class="tn"><h3>Transcriber's note:</h3>
<p>Archaic words, variations in spelling, punctuation and hyphenation
have been retained except in obvious cases of typographical error.</p>

<p>The following footnotes had no anchors and hence were added by the
transcriber:</p>

<blockquote><p>Footnote 11: "Ego me non arbitror hoc honore dignum." (Er. Ep. i, p.
653.)</p>

<p>Footnote 112: Erasm. Ep. 274.</p>

<p>Footnote 128: "Was gross sol werden, muss klein angeben." (Mathesius,
Hist. p. 3.)</p>

<p>Footnote 563: There was no anchor for the footnote "Seckend. p. 137."
The transcriber has supplied it.</p></blockquote>

<p>On page 47 there is a footnote anchor with no matching footnote at
"Promise me that you will always think so." The transcriber has placed
an asterisk at the location.</p>

<p>Table of Contents incorrectly lists Book II Chapter IX as beginning on
page 94. The transcriber has changed the number to 93. Likewise the
page number for Chapter X has been changed from 168 to 167. For Book
III Chapter V, the page number has been changed from 204 to 203.</p>
